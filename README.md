# EverQuest 2 Data

This is just a collection of data that I've extracted from EQ2 game log files. For me, it's useful as I'm using it to populate data for a website I've recently started working on, https://eq2db.com . I wanted to make it public in case anyone else finds it useful.

I'm not entirely happy with the layout of the files, so they might change at some point in the future. There is also still a lot of data missing. But, for the most part, it does include:

1. Zone data (name, zonerect, shinies, shiny locations, resource nodes, resource node locations)
2. NPC data (name, location, zone data, drops, merchant data)
3. Faction data (name, description)

Known issues:
1. Full dialogs between player and NPC are not captured. NPC dialog is the only thing recorded.
