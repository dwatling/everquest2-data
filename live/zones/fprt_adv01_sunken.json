        "Greetings, adventurer. What business do you have here?",
        "I suppose formal introductions are in order. I am Inquisitor Thorson, sent by my masters in the Dismal Rage to investigate a recent increase in undead activity here.",
        "The Dismal Rage looks after the spiritual needs of Freeport's people. We congregate in the Temple of War. We are made up largely of priests, though we do employ other professions from time to time.",
        "Though in ancient times our priests served the old gods, we no longer bow to such archaic symbols of authority. Today the Dismal Rage serves the Overlord and our high priestess, Xilania Nevagon.",
        "Some of us believe it was not the gods themselves that were the true power, but rather the planar forces they represented. The ancient gods were symbols, the embodiment of the principles we now serve.",
        "We draw our power from many sources, including the principles of Hate, Fear, War, and Decay. There are sects within the Dismal Rage dedicated to all these ideals and more, though we are united in our service to the Overlord and High Priestess Nevagon.",
        "You have arrived in the Sunken City, once a thriving district of Freeport. Now it stands as a monument to the madness of those who would have sacrificed our beloved city to the waves.",
        "I will tell you more if you want to hear it, but first I must review the notes I have been taking on what I have observed since my arrival here. To learn a bit more about this place, go through the archway just ahead and speak to an iksar named Saydith Yarr.",
        "Excellent. Return to me after you have spoken to him.",
        "Did you speak to Saydith Yarr?",
        "Saydith has been here a long time, and I think he has gone a bit mad. I can tell you more about this place if you like, or we can skip all that and you can do some work for me.",
        "The Sunken City is haunted, by both the spirits of those innocents who died here and by the fallen Prexians who caused this catastrophe. It is said that there are even more spirits who walk these flooded streets after night falls.",
        "When the undead are defeated and their spirits are freed, they often leave behind a spectral essence that, if properly analyzed, reveals much about their past. I must find out what is causing the increase in activity among the undead. I need you to obtain four spectral essences from the undead creatures.",
        "The undead walk just ahead, though some lurk a bit farther in. Remember, more of these ghastly creatures can be found after night falls. Return to me when you have their essences.",
        "Hello again. Do you have the spectral essences I asked you to obtain?",
        "Well done! These essences will aid in my research. It will take me some time to study them. While I do that, it may be a good idea for you to have a look around and discover some of the other inhabitants of the Sunken City.",
        "This place is home to more than just the spirits of those who died here. I've been told there are a few types of vermin scattered around the Sunken City, and I'd like you to confirm their presence for me.",
        "Crabs like to roam in shallow water, so I need a rough estimate of their density here. You should find plenty of brine sifters just through the archway, as well as farther on to the east.",
        "Though a coastal city, Freeport has a very arid climate. Scorpions may be found here on some of the dry portions of ground. You might try going west, then south a bit.",
        "Of particular interest to me are the strange rust monsters that scurry around here. There is little information on where they come from, but they showed up in this area after the destruction caused by the Rending. They get their name not only for their brownish color, but for their odd taste for consuming rusty metal. If any of your gear becomes rusty due to the moisture here, be on your guard.",
        "The Knowledge Book you obtained on the Outpost of the Overlord contains many Abilities that will prove useful to you. Among these Abilities is one called Catalogue Creature. If you draw close to a creature, you can use this ability to obtain information about it. Everything I need to know will be recorded in your Quest Journal. There is no need to attack any of these creatures, simply use the Catalogue Creature ability on them.",
        "Greetings once again. Have you studied the local wild creatures?",
        "Well done! Your reputation as a hard worker is well earned. It seems there is no shortage of life here in the Sunken City, even if most of it scuttles about in the shadows.",
        "I am not the only one sent here by the Dismal Rage. Some of my allies have ventured deeper into the Sunken City. In fact, since I have completed my examination of the spectral essences you obtained, I need you to take the information to one of them.",
        "Seek out Investigator Curfeld, a highly respected member of our order. He has spent a lot of time researching the events that transpired here, and no doubt has some insight into the recent rise in undead activity. Take my findings on the spectral essences and give them to him.",
        "You can find Investigator Curfeld by going north through the archway, then west and south. He stands past the scorpions you discovered near the gateway to the Graveyard. He knows that additional help is coming, so tell him that I sent you.",
        "This cursed place holds many secrets that must be uncovered.",
        "Thank you for assisting the Dismal Rage in investigating the Sunken City. Has Investigator Curfeld made any crucial discoveries?",
        "Ah, thank you. I'm glad to have someone of his expertise in charge of these matters. I will look through his journal as I prepare to return to the City of Freeport to present my report. If I may ask, what did the investigator have you do?",
        "Pirates, eh? I'd heard rumors of their kind stashing their goods around here. I guess they figured no one would go looking for stolen goods in a place that is haunted by the spirits of the past. I assume he asked you to report their activity to the Freeport Militia.",
        "Documents? Well, surely Investigator Curfeld knows what's best. What else did he ask you to do?",
        "The ruins of that ancient shrine are certainly cursed. No doubt he asked you to destroy the shrine and sanctify the ground.",
        "What? I don't understand it. Why would he not want the shrine destroyed, especially if it still has arcane power? Let me see if he explains it in this journal.",
        "Wait... what is going on? This journal isn't about ending the threat of the undead and keeping Freeport safe. It contains notes on how to recreate the spell used by Elwyn Aquel and the Circle of Darkfathom to destroy our city!",
        "I'd heard it said that members of the investigator's family were worshipers of Prexus. They must have been members of the Circle of Darkfathom. Our city is in grave danger! We have to stop him!",
        "There's no time to waste! Curfeld must not be allowed to complete this unholy ritual. The safety of Freeport itself is at stake! Go back and face him. You must put an end to his foul scheme before all is lost.",
        "You have my full authority to take whatever action is necessary. Fear not; I will ensure that the high priestess and the rest of the Dismal Rage know that your actions were necessary to save our city. Do this, and not only will you be rewarded but your fame will grow. Hurry, go!",
        "The Dismal Rage will find the source of this undead uprising.",
        "You're back! Did you stop Investigator Curfeld?",
        "Splendid work! I cannot express how pleased I am with all you have done for us. Your name shall be known within the Dismal Rage as a true hero. I would not be surprised if the Overlord himself hears of your actions this day. Please, take this reward as a token of thanks.",
        "I must remain here to finish my report for the Dismal Rage. However, I would like you to journey to the Freeport Ruins and seek out an acquaintance of mine named Captain Arellius. I have heard that your help is much needed there. I will send word that you are coming, hero of Freeport.",
        "The fastest route to the Ruins is to use the mariner's bell at the end of the dock for traveling outside the city proper. This will summon transportation to take you to the Ruins, where Captain Arellius of the Freeport Militia will be awaiting your assistance.",
        "You can speak to Custodian Zaddar in the Graveyard and Enforcer Kurdek in the Sprawl. They could both use assistance from an able adventurer.",
        "Thank you for all your help, my friend. I will speak favorably of you to my superiors."
