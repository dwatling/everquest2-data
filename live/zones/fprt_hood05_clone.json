Those of us who care about our heritage, those of us who are truly Teir`Dal, are searching for a way to return to the grace and legacy of our people. It would seem that such a way has already been found...",

        "If the city has been shut out from the rest of the world and returned to its proper place of dominion in the Underfoot, then there are no longer any wasteful attempts at conquering this abominable haven of refuse, now are there?",
        "No surface campaign has proved fruitful. The Teir`Dal are the ruling force in the Underfoot. No subterranean race rivals our power and none can withstand our dominion. Besides, ownership of the surface world would be tantamount to owning a dung hill festering with maggots and flies.",
        "I long for the day when I return home. While I am still here, though, I choose to educate curiosity-seekers. Would you like to know anything else?",

        "I was very young when the siege began, but I saw the entrance collapsing as I fought in the forest with the other dragoons. It became silent as the rumbling destruction came to pass. All fighting ceased; everyone was in awe of the unexpected event. I can't be certain of what happened, exactly. All that I know is that a great force collapsed the cavern."
