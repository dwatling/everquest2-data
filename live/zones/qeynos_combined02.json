Along with that is the ability to demoralize an enemy by any means possible. Yes, this is intimidation, but we use it as a tool to protect those who need it.",

        "It's simple! You see, there's a couple of things in Graystone Yard that most everyone liked to do; drink, and fight. And many of us like to do both quite a bit. It's part of the reason you might have a hard time finding an intact, standing table anywhere in the Yard back in the day.",
        "Of course! Well, it seemed that not everyone appreciated the noise that might be generated when these two pastimes are intermingled. In fact, we apparently racked ourselves up a fair amount of complaints from the harbor and from people here in the Elddar Grove.",

        "We did. It so happened that the wine cellar under the inn was well insulated, and proved to dampen out the sound sufficiently. The innkeeper was more than happy to have us meet down there, as long as we were careful with the wine barrels, and paid for what we busted.",
        "Well, as I'm sure you could imagine, we ended up spending quite a bit on broken barrels of wine. It was worth it to us, though. After a time, we found that we were getting quite good at our brawling. We began to hold contests, and share technique ideas with one another, which benefited the group as a whole.",
        "Well, as I said, we have always wanted to use our skills to help protect those around us. It was a tough sell, however. The monks here were not impressed with our capabilities, and the guard considered us a nuisance. However, once we were able to gain their respect through our actions, they allowed us to purchase an old building, and set up the Graystone Guild as an official guild within Qeynos.",
        "Well, once the ruckus in the Graystone Yard started, we did what we could to stem the violence, but members of our guild were turning on each other, becoming enraged themselves! We couldn't stay in there any longer, and needed to find a new place to train. The monks were kind enough to let us join with them here, which is quite beneficial for all of our students!",

        "To give that answer is to give you background on the Eye of Bayle themselves.  You see, the Eye was formed after the sudden death of Antonius Bayle the first.  His passing was unexpected, and there were whispers of an assassination.  Although there was no evidence to prove this to be the case, enough of the court believed it, even if in secret.",
        "They surmised that if indeed there was an assassination, it was unlikely the assassin would ever be caught, and even if they were, the assassination was already done.  They felt that it was best to attempt to head these threats off before they happened.  To wage a war with the shadows in the shadows, to fight them on their ground.",
        "Correct.  We were created to meet these dark threats head on, out of sight from the rest of the world.  We conducted our work in secret, keeping all knowledge of our existence only to ourselves and to select members of the Council.  It was imperative that the populace at large was unaware of our existence, for many would find our methods less than palatable.",
        "We were caught off guard during the attempted kidnapping of Antonia Bayle.  Our order was powerless to stop the attempt, and had it not been for the intervention of others, it's likely that she would have been taken from us.  Our contacts in the Council were not pleased, and we wore the blame for the kidnapping attempt for not having stopped it.",
        "They threatened to disband us, and have us arrested as assassins.  They said that we were no longer a necessary part of the protection of the Bayle line, as others had proven themselves more capable.  We argued that there was no way to prevent what happened, given the nature of the attempt, but there was no give.  They were going to do what they were going to do.",
        "Little did we know, Antonia herself had overheard part of the conversation, and she entered the room.  She demanded an explanation, which we were bound to give.  She was shocked to learn of our existence, and asked question after question trying to learn all that she could.  When we were finished, she dismissed everyone save me.",
        "She told me that she could not protect the order as things were.  As long as we remained hidden, the Councilors could have us dismantled from the inside, and no one would ever miss us – we never existed.  She felt that the Eye of Bayle was a necessary functioning part of Qeynos's security, and did not want to see us disbanded.  Thus, she made a bold decision.",
        "That is correct.  She recognized that there may be some political backlash from the assassins coming forth – the word \"assassin\" itself conjures up thoughts of villainy and shadowy deeds.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  We operate under a strict code of behavior, which all of our number are required to adhere to.  We work to protect not only the Queen, but the citizens as well.  We are the first and last line of defense against the shadows.",

        "Good. Your task is to crash a secret meeting we have learned about between two factions  of the highwaymen. The meeting is set to take place within the Down Below. The rumor is that there might be a plot against Qeynos and we need to find out what it is.",

        "Greetings, <player name>. I assume all went well? What information were you able to gather?",
        "We will not stand for this. You must go and track down this assassin. I would start your search in North Qeynos. You will likely need to lean heavily on your tracking skills.",
        "Because that is where I would stay if I were waiting for the Queen to show herself.",
        "You have full authority to take the assassin out. In fact, I encourage it. We do not  want them getting away and attempting this again!",
        "I heard of your heroics. It was quite a battle.",
        "I have eyes everywhere in this city. It is very difficult to hide things from me. Regardless, your heroics are commendable. Please report back to Master Rysian Gladewalker. I will ensure he knows of your heroics. Do you have any questions?",

        "That is true. I had not gotten any information on such a plot unfolding within the gates of Qeynos. I will put in a good word with the jury when his time comes to face his punishment. I will make sure he still gets his shot at becoming a citizen, though he may have to start over.",

        "That it is!  It's here we spend time teaching others the techniques we developed and honed, both from fighting each other, and from observation of others who were trained as brawlers. We've all worked together to help perfect our art, and now the Guild, under the direction of Dalluk, is looking to teach others what we've learned.",
        "He is. He is the best of us, without question. It was his idea to start the guild as well, and ultimately through him that we were able to overcome the apathy we were greeted with from those around us.",
        "So, as I'm sure you can imagine, we didn't all always just come here to fight. We had trades and duties, and Dalluk was no exception. He is a merchant by trade, selling and buying items from his contacts in Kelethin. The nightly brawls were his way, as with all of us, of a manner of relaxation. It might sound strange that fighting might be relaxing, but we found that you really get to know others and yourself in a brawl.",
        "Dalluk was far and away the best of us. He seemed to have a sixth sense about fighting, and even when outnumbered three-to-one, he nearly always came out on top, and when he didn't, he would just laugh and say that he clearly hadn't had enough ale. He was able to watch any of us in a fight, and immediately know our weaknesses and how to counter our moves.",
        "It happened that on one of those trips to Faydwer, he came across a young elf mage under attack from aviaks in Butcherblock Mountains. Without hesitation, he jumped into the fray, and began fighting them as he might fight one of us. He claims he remembers little of it, except that once it was over, he was standing, and the aviaks were not. Using the skills we developed here, he was able to defeat armed, deadly creatures.",
        "It was! When he returned, he excitedly relayed the story, and insisted that we could use these skills to help others, just as he had helped the mage back in Faydwer. We were dubious – the residents here were none too pleased with our activities, and the word of a drunken dwarf and a single elven mage wasn't going to change anyone's minds.",
        "Dalluk had an idea. He reckoned that if we were to receive backing from the monks here in Qeynos, our operation could be legitimized and we could become officially recognized within the city. So, with almost the same vigor that he used to confront the aviaks, he made his way to Elddar to speak with the monks.",
        "Not hardly. We were nearly laughed out.  They believed us undisciplined and unfocused, saying that we would be more of a harm than a help to anyone. The worst of the bunch was Sensei Shoda's right hand, Karuda.  He berated our art, and Dalluk in particular. Finally, Dalluk had enough, and challenged him.",
        "Karuda didn't believe it at first, and waved us off. But Dalluk didn't move, and said he wasn't leaving without the fight. Karuda refused, and turned to walk away, but Sensei Shoda was there behind him. He ordered Karuda to honor Dalluk's request, and fight him.",
        "Karuda was furious. He immediately turned and squared off with Dalluk, and both waited for Sensei Shoda to call the start of the fight. After a few tense seconds, the call came to begin, and Karuda immediately attacked Dalluk. I wish I could have slowed time at that moment. Dalluk simply pulled back his fist, waited for the monk to come close, and then, caught Karuda square in the jaw with his fist. It was over in one punch.",
        "He was, but not with us. He said that it was clear that Karuda let his emotions cloud his view, and that he should always take an opponent seriously. The whole exercise was a lesson for Karuda. Sensei Shoda said he saw strength within us, and told Dalluk that he would offer his backing for our guild. With his support, we received our recognition."

For now though, prove your worth by killing ten of the beasts for me.",

Throughout the history of Norrath, the druids have held clandestine gatherings away from the eyes of others.  Many of these were held at the ancient druid stones, most of which have been lost now.  The circle closest to Qeynos has been blocked for an age untold, but I would like you to venture to it.",

The actual path itself is cleverly hidden, by my reckoning it lies just three to four hundred cogs north of the old Blackburrow entrance.  Return here when you've had a look at the pass."

        "Great! We are in need of someone with excellent ranged skills. Are you such a scout?",
        "I'm glad you asked! We currently have an outstanding task that needs carrying out with the Baubbleshire. It seems the gnomes and halflings are doing fairly well against the portal creatures that have arrived there. However, they are struggling against certain creatures that are out of their reach.",
        "Yes, yes, please do! Oh! While you are in there we got a request from the Concordium to grab samples of the portals within the zone. They are working on something in order to close the portals for good, but need fragments of them for their testing. If you bring them back to me I can get them into the right hands.",
        "Make sure to get fragments of the portals appearing in Baubbleshire while you are taking out the creatures around the skies.",

        "The residents of Nettleville have reported that the Circle of Ten have been setting traps in and around their homes in an attempt to catch blood crazed freeblood. The problem is the  traps cannot tell between a blood crazed freeblood and a normal innocent citizen.",
        "No, actually, I believe there are other organizations working on that front. We need to protect the people in other ways.",
        "Well, the whole situation with the Circle of Ten is a touchy one. If we go in there and just destroy the traps, it will look like an act of aggression against the Circle of Ten, and thats the last thing we need right now.",
        "I assume you are well versed in disarming traps... So, go in and disarm them, then tamper with the trigger pin so they do not go off. The Circle of Ten will just assume they are a bad batch of traps and hopefully abandon the use of them altogether.",
        "Yes, indeed they do. They are just as dangerous as the traps are to the citizens. If you run into any of them make sure to dispose of them.",
        "Did you take care of those traps? You didn't get caught did you?",
        "Good point! Are you ready for something else? It just so happens I have another task here that needs done and I think you have the skills needed for this.",
        "While you were gone I gave a task to one of our less skilled scouts, Gelerth Bucklebrow.  It was just a routine supply retrieval from a thief in the Graystone Yard. I'm afraid he hasn't checked in, and knowing his skill level, I'm afraid something may have happened to him.  How are your skills with tracking?",
        "Good to hear. You will likely need those skills in order to find him. There is quite a brawl that seems to be happening in the Graystone Yard at the moment. In fact, I hear the Qeynos Guard has had quite a time of getting them under control.",
        "Yes, they do. Your primary goal there is to find Gelerth but if you see a brawl breaking out feel free to teach them a lesson!",
        "Return to me once you have him safe.",
        "Is Gelerth safe?",
        "Excellent. I commend you on your actions. I'm not sure he would have lasted long in that situation. Luckily you were around to save him.",
        "Oh yes, we plan to get him trained up a bit more before sending him anywhere else.  Speaking of training, I'm afraid there is no more that I can teach you as your skill level might even rival my own. In fact, I am fairly certain your skill level rivals my own. I would like you to go and speak to one of the masters of our order, Master Rysian Gladewalker.",
