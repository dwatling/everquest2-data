        "Harclave felt a terrible woe befall him as he groped around in the dark.  It was at this moment that he spied a glowing light gleaming through a crack in the distant wall.",
        "Desperate for light, Harclave strode towards the wall, unaware of the deep chasm echoing in the distance.  With a yelp of surprise, our hero plunged into the depths of the caverns!",
        "Fortunately, Harclave landed in one of the cavern's deep pools, or our tale would end here. But our hero was destined for greatness. As Harclave pulled his bedraggled body from the dark waters, he found himself surrounded by a band of Zygomyd hunters."
