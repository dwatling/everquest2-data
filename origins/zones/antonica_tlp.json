Occasionally a gnoll will claim enough victories that the powers that be will allow him a chance at speaking with the ancestors and receiving their support. It hasn't happened that I know of, but I am hardly on speaking terms with the gnolls, hah hah!",

I've been cooped up here longer than I had hoped and I just can't stop wondering how my favorite spots are right now. Are the fish biting? Have the gnolls fished 'em out yet? I can't stand not knowing! Can you please go check my fishin' spots for me and let me know how they are?",

Here, let me see that journal you've got there and I'll write down all my favorite spots for you. Mind you, I'd take it as a favor if you don't go showin' this to anyone else.

I thought I'd try to do some fishin' here at this nice pond since I'm stuck until I can heal enough to get back to my favorite fishin' holes. Just as I was getting set up, I realized I'd lost my favorite lure! I must have dropped it somewhere up on the beach north of here near where I fell. With my leg like this, I can't go and look for it myself. I don't suppose you might be able to help find it for me?",

        "I'm sorry to trouble you again after all that you've done, but I need you to find a specific fish for me. I've been trying to catch him for a long time now, but he's a cunning old devil and he always gets away.",
        "His name is Ol' One Eye. He's been living in these waters for some time and has eluded many a would-be fisherman. Can you go look for him and let me know if he's still out there? I just can't stop wonderin' where he is.",

        "Well, hello again. It's good to see you. I don't suppose that you can offer me a little more assistance?",
        "My cousin had a tin of bait for me, but he left it sitting at an abandoned camp to the south of here while he was out and about. Now I hear some gnolls have moved in. Do you think you can pick up the bait for me?",

        "Indeed. I have heard of the help you have provided me, I am quite thankful.",
        "Save your manners. Thanking you was not the reason I called you here. I wish to ask for your help once again.",
        "The Sabertooth gnolls are growing bolder each day. Magnon and Tyllia--both with your help--provided me with a great deal of information. Under the banner of the Sabertooth, the Cavemaw and Darkpaw gnolls have been expanding their operations. I wanted to tell both Magnon and Tyllia this but I have twice had gnolls attack my couriers--this is not normal.",
        "That was my first question too. Fast, efficient trade routes have been opened up between Blackburrow and Antonica. I don't know the precise plans of the gnolls that remain in Blackburrow. The gnolls in Antonica, however, seem to be preparing for a big offensive. They are not yet prepared for such an action, but they will be soon. This is why I ordered Magnon to hold off on further exploration of the cave.",
        "Exactly. The gnolls aren't smart, but they're not stupid either. The plan for this offensive isn't some kind of raid meant to get supplies, but rather a permanent move into the open of Antonica. The gnolls want to expand their caved cities into every mountain and hill. Now, obviously the people of Antonica would never let this happen--but the gnolls aren't smart enough to realize that. They will attempt it and many lives will be lost.",
        "Not very soon. If we need, we have plenty of time to prepare. However, I would prefer to stop it before it even starts, and that is where you come in.",
        "I've been managing some units of the Qeynos Guard. I have had them watching a number of gnoll encampments across Antonica. Many of these gnolls will make up a sizable portion of the army the gnolls hope to amass. Soon I will give the word to strike. While I'm doing that I need your help on the battlefield but at a higher level.",
        "I have intelligence that points me to five gnolls who will play very specific roles in this plot. Once you have taken them out we will allow word to reach the camps. As that occurs the guards will decimate the camps, leaving a few gnolls alive so that the rest will hear their stories. The blow to their morale should be enough to put this plot on the backburner for good.",
        "The first is Animator Z'Apha. There is a farm just southwest of here. Z'Apha has been sending scarecrows into the fields of Antonica. He hasn't acted yet, but I do not want to wait for that. Head down to that farm, kill eight of his rotstuffed scarecrows, and put an end to Animator Z'Apha.",
        "Return to me once you've finished.",
        "Z'Apha and his minions?",
        "Good, good. Are you ready for the next one?",
        "Good. Bra'ak the Reptile has been training gnolls in the hills north of here. He's a skilled assassin and we need to take him out before his knowledge has sunk too far into the ranks of the Sabertooth gnolls. Kill him and six of the Sabertooth darkstriders that share his camp. You can find him in the rocky hills north of here--just south west of the Vale of Shattering.",
        "We will all feel safer with him out of the picture. Be safe, <player name>.",
        "Do you have news?",
        "Most excellent, <player name>. Our work is progressing. Are you ready for the next gnoll?",
        "Tactician Mengs has always been--at least by gnoll standards--a military genius. You can find him in the tunnel that leads to the Steppes far to the south west. It rests behind the waterfall at the southern end of the river to our west. Kill him and his guards.",
        "It is my guess that he is the one who planned the Antonican siege. With him out of the way I do not believe the gnolls can properly handle a dynamic battlefield.",
        "The tactician?",
        "Excellent. Are you ready for an easy break? Our latest reports place the final two gnolls in the same location.",
        "North west of here. Graalwen and Jayl'Krik. There is a mountain just this side of the river. Upon that mountain Graalwen and Jayl'Krik have set up temporary camps. They are task masters from Blackburrow and are being sent to the Cavemaw and Darkpaw packs. For now they are in their camps with a number of guards. When you go for them, also take out a number of the camp and spear guards. To break the Blackburrow elite will be a great psychological victory.",
        "Good luck, <player name>.",

But, you see, I'm not quite as young as I used to be, and I need a bit of help. Sometimes I wonder why I waste my time with this fool.",

        "Right, well, that's pretty much what I said. Well, let's see what you can do then, shall we? Yes we shall. There are some gnolls quite a ways west of here. Boring, shiftless lot if you study 'em much, and I did. They don't amount to much yet, but I still keep an eye on 'em.",
        "But yer fluffy lads directly south of here, now there's an active bunch. I think I saw them hiding some boxes once, long ago. They may not know they're being watched, but they are paranoid regardless. And the grubs... that's the confusing part.",
        "Aye, they've got soil rich with these strange grubs out in front of their cave. They're out there collecting these things all day and all night. I've never seen them eating them--and I've seen these dogs eat--so I have no idea what they're using them for. But I'd like to find out. Naturally, <player name>, that is where you come in. Do ya feel ready?",
        "Good! Their cave is south of here, hard to miss--especially with all those hunters parading around out front. I'd like ya to do two things. First, kill yourself some of them grub hunters. They're creepy, I tell ya. Second, collect some of those grubs for us, so we can try to figure out what they're using them for.",
        "And be careful! That cave is deep, who knows what lurks down in there. Just stay out front for now. That's what I would do, anyway.",
        "Well, what have ya got?",
        "Great work! I'll start working on these right away. We'll see what we can figure out. While I'm doing that I have a task for you.",
        "Lord Kylar sent word to me. His son was out practicing some swordplay and was abducted by gnolls. He received a very poorly written ransom note, which is good because it means the lad is alive. Gnolls have never been proper negotiators, in fact I'd wager hostages are harmed more often when negotiations are attempted. The best way to save that young man would be to find him and kill his captors.",
        "Aye. It shouldn't prove too difficult. Just don't give the gnolls enough time to think. If you attack, they'll jump on ya, it's their nature. Lord Kylar says he knows where the gnolls are, so you should report to him. You can find him at the Keep of the Ardent Needle. It's west of here.",
        "Come back once you've helped him out, I'll get to work on these grubs right away.",
        "How did it go?",
        "As I suspected you would. I am glad to hear it.",
        "Nothing, it would seem. I tested them for any imbued magic and the like and came up empty handed. They are very effective at catching fish, though. Perhaps the gnolls were using them for that. Really, though, they might be eating them. Keep in mind, these gnolls are astonishingly boring to watch. I had hoped to find something in the grubs, but did not.",
        "Hardly! This is the best fishing I've had in weeks! Are you ready to continue your assignment?",
        "Good. I've spotted more of those fabled crates I spoke of prior. There was no mistaking it this time, the gnolls are definitely keeping supplies within the cave. What I managed to get a hold of myself was, as I suspected, worthless, sundry gnollstuff. No use to anyone, save the gnolls. So I'd like you to take care of it.",
        "Head into their cave and make a mess of it! There are Cavemaw tunnelers and tamers in there and I want you to take them out as you hit the supplies. You shouldn't have to go very deep, yet still it will put a rather large dent in their situation here. Not enough to scare them off, but enough to help us out in the long run.",
        "I know you can. Come back to me once you're done, I'm working on a plan that will take us deeper into those caves.",
        "Did ya get 'em?",
        "Good... good.",
        "No, actually...",
        "I don't know, honestly. Word came down from Bulvar. He doesn't want me--or you for that matter--messing around in that cave any longer. He didn't give any reason, he just told me it was important. I trust him, but I certainly am confused by it. I'm sure he'll tell me soon enough. Perhaps you'll know before I do! He asked me to ask if you would be willing to speak with him. Are you?",
        "He'll be glad of it. You can find him easy enough in the Keep of the Gnollslayers. Head east along the shore to the Oracle Tower griffin station. From there hop a griffin to the Steppes station. Once you land, head north you'll come to the keep. Bulvar will be waiting for ya.",
        "Thanks to Bulvar I now have plenty of time to fish! And these blessed grubs work great! Thanks again, <player name>.",

        "What of the boat and the gnolls?",
        "By Zek, an empty boat is worthless. At least the neophytes and runts have been slain. Their foul stench will soon return, however. I have another task for you if you're willing.",
        "The island over there, the middle of the three--the westernmost of the two gnoll controlled islands--is far more vulnerable than its eastern twin. I know not what lingers there but I would ask that you find out. Slay the gnolls upon the island.",
        "Return to me once this is done.",
        "Well?",
        "That is a relief...  And what of the island itself? Were there supplies? Perhaps a shipping port of some sort.",
        "Then it must be on the other island... that is unfortunate. Will you go back, <player name>?",
        "You'll have to venture to the other island. It is fortified with stronger ranks and far more dangerous. I would not recommend setting foot on it, but I believe you can still find the dock by swimming about the isle, the gnolls won't notice you then. Yes, I think that is the best bet.",
        "As I said, if we can determine what items the gnolls are moving we are that much closer to discovering their plans... if they even have plans; I do hope the gnolls are not bent on making a more permanent residence here. However, at the docks I am certain you will find a manifest of some sort. Find it and bring it to me.",
        "Remember, you don't need to fight the entire island. The manifest should be on or near the docks. Good luck, <player name>.",
        "Did you get the manifest?",
        "Thank you. Hmm... arcanic fluids? <player name>, the time to act is now. Will you continue to offer your aid?",
        "Good. I'd like you to travel to the cave just north east of here. Find out what the gnolls are doing in there and report back to me. Bring me whatever proof you can of their activities.",
        "Do not worry about being discreet in as much as it concerns me, but do worry about your own safety.",
        "What have you found?",
        "Scarecrows?! How little sense all of this makes. If the gnolls are planning an offensive why use scarecrows? I will need time to think on this. In the meantime, <player name>, Bulvar has asked a favor of you.",
        "Aye. I spoke to him of the help you provided. He sees worth in you, <player name>. He would like that worth spent helping Magnon as you helped me. He is on the northern coast of Antonica, just west of the Oracle Tower griffin station. What do you say?",
        "I'm glad to hear it. He will be glad of your help, I am sure.",
        "West of here you will find the Qeynos station griffin tower. The trainer atop will gladly send you off to the Oracle Tower station. Once you land you can follow the coast west and you will come to Magnon's camp. Be well, <player name>. Thank you again for all your help.",
