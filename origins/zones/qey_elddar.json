If you're amiable to a task, I wouldn't mind finding out what you're made of.  I could use someone to investigate some things for me, but I need to be certain you're up to the challenge.",

Filthy and wild, they prey on the weak and unprepared.  On the other, the Bloodsabers have been said to be stalking the outskirts of the city, and perhaps even have agents in the catacombs.  If you were to choose one evil to fight, which would it be?",

Alas, that is neither a story for now, nor does it do much good to dwell on the past.  Perhaps some other time I can tell you that tale... For now though, prove your worth by killing ten of the beasts for me.",

I'm not so certain of their religious affiliations these days, but rest assured, they're no good.  If you can manage it, check the catacombs or outside the city and kill ten of their members.  If we make it dangerous to be a member, perhaps others will think long and hard before joining their cause."
