        "Hello there, what can I do for you?",
        "Training, eh?  Good to hear, willing able bodied citizens are sometimes hard to find.  To craft items you will either need to head out and harvest the raw materials on your own, or you might be able to buy them off the wholesaler downstairs.  To get started let us start with the most important thing in life, food and drink!  Provisioners are chefs and brewers, applying their culinary skills to provide a valuable service for the benefit of their allies.  Food and drink refresh the weary hero and can provide regenerative benefits.  To sample a taste of provisioning please create a Fried Frog Leg and then return to me.",
        "Excellent work.  When you have reached the fourth rank of professionalism you will be able to purchase new recipe books and learn from them.  Scribe the artisan essentials volume 4 recipe scroll if you haven't already.  We will now see if you have the chops to be an alchemist.  They create deadly poisons and magic potions from almost any material, benign or otherwise.  These concoctions provide benefits in battle, such as replenishment for the part or extra damage against a foe.  To begin, go craft a potion.  Bring me a Lesser Noxious Remedy.",
        "Well done.  Going from one side of the arcane to another let us now focus you on the path of a sage.   Sages possess an unsurpassed knowledge of the arcane.  They apply this knowledge by scribing combat arts and spells onto scrolls that increase the might of adventurers.  Show me that you can scribe an arcane bindings.",
        "Ahh, good work.  From pure magic to pure might, let us turn your training to the creation of weapons and heavy armor.  Weaponsmiths are masters of metallic weaponry including swords, axes, daggers, and hammers.  Only the most foolish adventurer would dare explore dangerous territory without a well made weapon at the ready.  Armorers are crucial when it comes to preparing fighters and adventurers for battle.  The longevity of even the greatest soldiers is dependent upon the skill of the armorer who equipped them.  Even though I am having you create a tin greatsword, you will get a taste of what the forge has to offer for either class.",
        "The armorer will focus on heavy armor, but a tailor will focus on the creation of light armor.    Tailors provide quality protective leather and cloth equipment for those adventurers who prefer to wear light armor.  They also craft backpacks and other items from cloth or leather.  Show me that you can create a tailored rawhide skullcap and I will continue your training.",
        "You are progressing nicely!  Another way that an adventurer can protect themselves is with a sturdy shield.  Woodworkers are skilled crafters creating staves, bows, and arrows for the defense of their allies as well as musical instruments for the higher pursuits of art and entertainment.  They also craft powerful totems that possess restorative properties.  Show me that you have what it takes to be a woodworker and return to me with an elm round shield.",
        "Well done indeed!  While you still have the sandpaper calloused hands, you should see if you are interested in carpentry.  Carpenters are much valued by their customers, particularly homeowners.  With their superb knowledge of craftsmanship and sculpting, there is no household furnishing they cannot create.  A sturdy chair is always welcome addition to any home, show me that you can make a primitive elm chair.",
        "Very nice!  The last profession that I could teach you is jewelcrafting.  Jewelers create talismans and jewelry.  These valuable items protect the wearer from harm and can increase the physical attributes of the adventurer.  Show me that you can create a malachite ring, and your training will be complete!",
        "Well done, well done!  Now that you have had a taste of each full profession, you will need to go to Ironforge Exchange and register for which field you would like to go into.  Seek out Alfred Ironforge on the docks of Qeynos Harbor.  If you liked provisioning, woodworking, or carpentry you will need to first hone your skills a Craftsman.  If you liked being an armorer, weaponsmith, or tailor, you will first need to hone your skills as an Outfitter.  If you liked jeweler, sage, or alchemist you will first need to hone your skills as a scholar.",
        "Well done, well done!  You have learned all I have to teach, if you haven't already you should go seek out Alfred Ironforge on the docks of Qeynos Harbor."
