        "So much to do!  So little time! I must finish my sweeping, but I need a new broom. Perhaps you'll help me in return for a precious stone?",
        "So much to do!  So little time!  I must get these tents in order, and all this sweeping is giving me blisters.  It wouldn't be so bad if there weren't all these little rocks about.",
        "These stones on the ground, of course ... I guess I swept away most of the pebbles, but I did keep one strange blue rock that I found in the dust.  If you agree to help me, I'll give you the precious stone as payment. Unfortunately, I'm short on coin.",
        "Great!  I need you to pick up my new broom. Don't worry! It's already paid for; I just haven't picked it up. Tawli Whiskwind, a halfling lass in the Baubbleshire, should have it ready for me. You may have a difficult time finding her -- she's always running around looking for the finest materials for her brooms.",
        "Aye, I told you she was a bit flighty.  Thank you for the broom and here is the stone I promised.  I hope it brings you good luck.",
        "I suppose that is up to you.  Maybe you can take it to a mineral expert somewhere in the city."
