First, head north up the slope into the Wilderwood or west into Cliffdiver Canyon and lay down some bears.  Returns when you are done.",

Some of my best work was claimed by someone else and I mean to fix that.  Not long ago, I intercepted part of a note one of the Tunarian spies was delivering.  They've hidden the remaining pieces.  We need to get them all back to learn more of what they're doing.",

        "What's that? You found more of the parchment?",

        "Good.  I wrote this note -- that's probably what puzzled you.  It contained a hidden message to Laena. I was...planning to meet her secretly.  Then I realized how foolish that would be, but had already sent her the note.",
        "By the Overlord, no! I waited for her here, as pre-arranged.  She did not come and next thing you know, one of the other men gave me part of the note and told me to investigate the Tunarians.  I couldn't tell if he knew my secret or not.",
        "What is it with you and killing?  No! I was grateful for the chance to find the rest of my note and destroy it before anyone else realized I had signed it! I thought Laena might still have the rest of it...and you proved that she at least had some of it still.",
        "Perhaps a jealous lover, or maybe she was torn apart by the wilderbears.  You must keep this secret.  My family will never understand the...indiscretion...I showed.  Nothing happened between Laena and me, so it's best forgotten.  Get rid of these scraps for me.  I must go back before I'm missed."

The Overlord's troops have secured the outpost, but there is a growing nuisance on the other side of the island that must be addressed. That is where you come in.",
        "I am Tayil N'Velex, attendant and confidant of the Overlord. I am here to ensure that our operation on this island is successful. You, on the other hand, will be assisting us with some field work to help prepare you for life as a citizen of Freeport.",
        "The Overlord is the fiercely courageous ruler of Freeport. A statue of his glorious visage graces the pond in the center of the outpost. Though he is merciless to his enemies, he is generous to those who serve him. Pray you never do anything to fall from his grace, <player name>.",
        "Freeport is the center of power and commerce on Norrath. The city sits on the eastern edge of the continent of D'Lere. This grand city shall be your home here on Norrath, should you prove yourself worthy. If not, you can cower and beg for shelter at the gates of Qeynos.",
        "The city of Qeynos is the enemy of Freeport. It is a weak land ruled by an incompetent queen, Antonia Bayle. I've had my share of battles with her and her pet kerra, I assure you. Qeynosians try to spread lies about the Overlord and portray him as some kind of power-mad tyrant. Don't believe their propaganda, <player name>!",
        "Remember to always keep the will of the Overlord foremost in your thoughts and you will go far. The city of Freeport is a power unrivaled on Norrath, no matter what you might hear from Qeynosian riffraff. You must pledge yourself to this power and become part of it. Do this and I will reward you handsomely.",
        "Excellent! There is indeed much potential in you. I think it is time to begin your training.",
        "You must be strong if you wish to serve properly. Northwest of here you can find Trainer Darg Frostwind. Speak with him about combat training and do as he tells you.",
        "In case you forget, I've written down his name and location in your quest journal.",
        "So, <player name>, are you ready to learn more about the outpost and perform your first service for the Overlord?",
        "This outpost was recently established as a training ground for potential citizens of Freeport to hone their skills. Our first scouts on the island reported it as being uninhabited, perfect for our needs. It soon became clear that the initial reports were incorrect, and those scouts have been permanently reassigned to the bottom of the bay. Such is the price of failure.",
        "The intruders are a sect of the Tunarian Alliance, a lowly order of vermin originating from Qeynos. As a true servant of the Overlord, your duty is to eliminate them. This should prove extremely useful in preparing you for the challenges that lie ahead after you leave the outpost.",
        "Not just yet, <player name>. You will strike against those Qeynosian scum when the time is right. First we need to see if that weapon of yours is working! Are you ready for your first test?",
        "Go talk to Chef Gorga just past the west archway. She needs help gathering supplies to feed the members of the Freeport Militia who guard this outpost, which should provide a chance to test your combat skills. There is more to hunt on this island than just Qeynosians.",
        "Report back to me when your duties with Chef Gorga are done.",
        "Did you enjoy your hunting in the Seaside Glade with Chef Gorga?",
        "Gorga was impressed with your handiwork. I'm sure the outpost Militia guards will be pleased with her stew, though I can't stomach troll cooking myself. You show potential indeed, <player name>. As promised, here is your reward.",
        "So, <player name>, are you ready to prove your worth again?",
        "Good, now listen closely. Though a direct attack upon your enemy can be quite satisfying, there are often more subtle means of inflicting damage. Cut off the feet and the head is sure to follow, if you get my meaning.",
        "Indeed, cunning and subtlety are often effective. And who is more cunning and subtle than an assassin? We've established a camp through the archway to the west, at the far end of Seaside Glade. Go there and speak to Assassin Vamir, who has devised a plan to strike at the heart of the Tunarians.",
        "Assassin Vamir will explain the details.  Good luck.",
        "Perhaps you did not read my note.  Are you prepared to lend your services to the Overlord once again?",
        "We have discovered that the Tunarian Alliance's main source of income is from a mine in the Wilderwood. The mine is the perfect setting to employ our next strategy for conquering the island: distraction. By causing a disruption at the mine, it will allow us to flank the Qeynosians from the opposite side.",
        "Who better to teach you the fine art of distraction than a coercer? Return to the camp in Seaside Glade where Coercer Zlith will fill you in on the details of our plan.  Report back to me after you have succeeded against the Tunarians.",
        "The Tunarian Alliance's resources are dwindling and their forces are focused on defending the mine. The time has come to strike the final blow. Are you prepared to face your greatest challenge so far?",
        "The Militia has pushed through the Tunarian Alliance's line into the Valley of Discipline, the area they use to train their animals. Our forces have set up a forward camp in an alcove located in the eastern portion of the valley near the archway leading to the falls.",
        "The Militia is using this position as our point of attack. Go to the camp and seek out Captain Tyreth, the leader of the forward operation. He will direct your efforts in this final phase of the assault. We will drive out the Tunarian Alliance and take their treasures as our own!",
        "The Overlord is counting on you.",
        "Your bravery has been noted, young one. The Tunarian Circle of Elders was defeated and their treasure is ours. The Militia troops will remain here to clear out the remaining Qeynosians, but they present no danger to us.",
        "It was my pleasure to fight beside you. I have no doubt that you will be well received in Freeport. When you are ready to leave the outpost and venture to our great city, speak with Captain Varlos on the deck of the Far Journey. His ship is waiting on the dock through the south archway. Farewell."
