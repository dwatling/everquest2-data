As you can see, this looks like an orc forward base if I ever saw one.  I don't have time to get back to Freeport to get some extra troops, so I'm going to have to ask for your help on this.  What say you?",
        "I'm really not supposed to share this information with you, but I have no choice since I can't get help from the city.  It's like this; the orcs have been assaulting Freeport for quite sometime now and the Overlord wants to strike the enemy hard and fast, so he's come up with a plan to assassinate their field commander, Overseer Maulic.  The orders state that the scouts say he should be lightly guarded and vulnerable to an assassination attempt.  That's where you come in.    ",

I can't be too sure though, I know that some of you adventurer types wield some pretty powerful magic.  If you are ready, I'll give you this makeshift key I fabricated out of scrap orc weapons - this should get you past that door once the guards have been cleared.",
        "Okay, here you go.  I'll make for Freeport as soon as you head in and pass the word that you've begun the assassination attempt.  During the confusion of Maulic's assassination, we'll press the attack from the Freeport gates crushing these foul creatures in the name of the Overlord!",

        "I've been waiting on a very special shipment to arrive.  It was due here three days ago and there has been no sign of the individuals who were supposed to bring it.  I've had to send the boat to the Freeport docks and every day it sits there it's costing me money.  I need you to find out what happened to my shipment or why they are so late.",
        "That little bit of information you don't need to know.  All I'm asking for is that you find my missing cargo.",
        "Fine, if I have to hold your hand through everything.  You might start with Nethet near the main gates of Freeport.  He watches most of who enter or leave the city.  If anyone knows anything about where my missing cargo went it would likely be him.",

        "That's exactly what I wanted to hear.  Once you've thinned out the number of the dervishes for me I have a feeling they might be willing to negotiate a deal afterwards.  I want them to learn a lesson in fouling my business.  You can find one of the larger encampments on the far Western end of the Commonlands.",

        "That was faster than I expected, you're quite the dangerous one aren't you?  Well done, I applaud you and your efforts in our partnership here.  Keep it up and we might get very rich together.  Tell me, how many did you get rid of before coming back?",
        "I understand what you mean perfectly.  Here is the first of your profits, if you keep doing such excellent work there is a lot more where this came from.",
        "Shall we continue our business venture, partner?",
        "Good.  The dervishes are still not willing to negotiate.  I'm guessing they have either become more foolish than normal or they no longer have my shipment.",
        "Yes, but I have another source that we might be able to use to our advantage.  Another militia guard by the name of Captain Vertas is stationed out in the Crossroads.  He has no love for the dervishes and keeps a close eye on them.",
        "Hrm, you have?  Then what can you tell me about the dervishes that you learned from him?",
        "Yes, see what information he has on the dervishes and what we might be able to use. ",
        "He may have some other work for you while I try to find my sorcerer partner.",
        "Have you spoken with captain Vertas?",
        "The Deathfist?  You cannot be serious.  Bah!  That's probably where my shipment went, there's no way I'm getting that back by now.  The orcs also have to pay for this, they had to know that shipment was mine.  Do you mind playing enforcer again?",
        "Good, then I need you to find out what the connection is with with dervishes and the orcs.  If you watch carefully you can sometimes see orc runners near the encampments in the Southern part of the Commonlands.  I want the information they might be carrying.  Let me know what you find.",
        "It's good to see you again.  What did you learn from the orcs?",
        "Hrmmm.  So they are having a meeting are they?  Let me look into this and verify it isn't a trap.  Come back when you're ready to crash their meeting.",
        "Ah yes, your reward.  Here it is.  Remember that I have more work and more rewards when you return.",

        "No, I'm sorry.  I'm not interested in any local treasures ... wait ... let me see that lightstone.  You're right! This isn't like the other lightstones in these lands.  In fact, I've never seen one like it. Could it be?  Is it beginning?  It's possible, but I must be sure. Will you do something for me?",
        "Good, good.  You didn't come upon this item by chance. You must be the one to set out on this quest. Seek out both the Mourned and the Forgotten.  One has fallen among brethren, the other alone. Both were valorous on the field of battle. Touch this stone to them and honor both.",

The great beast Rama'nai walks these lands at the head of his pride.  Slay him in honorable combat and dip the stone in his blood.  Return to me when you're done.",
        "I see you did as you were told. The stone continues to glow brighter.  To increase its power, you must right some wrongs.  Find the orc captains Gaer and Ogof.  They routinely direct their troops to destroy and rob the graves of the ancient Knights of Truth. You must avenge this defilement of the graves; doing so will increase the power of your stone.",
        "Excellent.  Greedy orc scavengers will no longer disturb the buried dead. Your stone grows brighter with each deed done in valor.  There is another soul in these lands who needs releasing from the eternal torment that chains him to this realm.  Will you free him?",
        "Long ago the Priests of Marr and the Knights of Truth administered to the people of these lands.  The current ruler of Freeport despised these people and managed to kill most of them long before the Shattering. The High Priest at the time was first cursed, then executed and then his corpse was tossed out in these lands for the scavengers to feast on.  His soul hasn't found deserved rest for centuries.",
        "Yes, you now bear an object that hasn't been seen on Norrath for centuries.  You hold the essence of the Greater Lightstone.  Defeat the cursed High Priest in battle while the lightstone is in his presence.  The powers of Valor and Truth imbued within will free him from his curse.  ",
        "Your lightstone glows brilliantly!  Your quest is almost over.  I must ask you to complete a final task. If you do this, I can fully imbue your lightstone.",
        "The elite among the Knights of Truth wielded the magical Swords of Truth. These weapons have been lost for many decades.  News has surfaced that an orc holds the hilt and broken edge of one of these lost blades; you must retrieve its remnants. With these ancient saber pieces I shall complete your Greater Lightstone.",
        "He's a leader among the Bloodskull clan of orcs.  Rumors state his camp lies in a hidden valley close to here.  Unfortunately, I don't know the location of the camp.  You must help me get this sword back into the proper hands; it's sacrilege for such a creature to possess it.",
        "I hoped when we met again you would bear the sword the orc leader possesses.  Please, recover the sword from that creature.",
        "You did it!  Now hand me the broken sword and your lightstone, and I will completely empower the stone.",
        "There!  The Great Lightstone is fully empowered with the essence of Valor, Truth, and Light!  I am truly sorry to have deceived you into thinking you could keep this stone. You must understand, it must stay with my Order. He's returning soon and we must preserve his artifacts to hasten his arrival.  It has truly pained me to speak untruthfully to you. I hope you understand the importance of this matter.",
        "You've been exceptionally brave and valorous in this quest.  If it weren't for the dire need of my order to possess this stone, I'd gladly hand it over to you.  You must understand ... what was that?",

        "Good to hear. That is the attitude we want to see in young recruits. I need you to travel back to the camp to the west. There you will need to remove some of the dervishes from the land of the living. ",

The militia requires you to travel to the west to the road beyond the druid ring to find the orc emissary.   Our reports tell us the emissary is the one who is passing stolen information to the Deathfist Empire.",

        "I guess not. You don't look like a spy. A spy wouldn't look so foolish. I need you to go scout out the dervish camps in the southwest area of The Commonlands. The note says they've set up camp in that area. Go there now and investigate it.",
        "Bring back any information you may find. Why are you still here?",
        "Really? Well, you may not be as useless as I first thought.",
        "For one so young, you have done well thus far. I still have more for you to do before I can let you go. Are you up to some undercover work?",
        "I like you, kid. What I need you to do is travel to their forward command camp and infiltrate their defenses. You will take this set of orders and switch them for their current list of orders.",
        "Oh, sorry sport. Will you take this mission or not? It will be dangerous. Something I'm sure is right up your alley.  If it's not, well... we'll have to send the medics, I guess.",
        "Great, hurry back! And try to come back in one piece.",
        "Very well done. Impressive, in fact. You have earned another rank on your insignia.",
        "You've done well up to this point, cadet. The information you have gathered so far has helped our cause. Now it's time I give you a real mission.",
        "You are now required to perform an important task for the Militia. Because of the fake orders you delivered, we were able to pinpoint the highest ranking officer in this regiment. Now, you must go and eliminate him.",
        "Shh...  Not so loud! I'll whisper it to you.  This type of information we do not speak in open areas. You never know who is listening. One spy hearing the wrong bit of information can ruin just about everything.",
        "May your path be silent, and your blade be true.",
        "I knew you had it in you, soldier. You have earned my highest respect. Take this insignia and wear it proudly as a symbol of your bravery as a member of the Militia.",

If you're interested in working for us, and increasing your exposure--even to the Overlord himself--I have someone I can put you in contact with. Interested?",

As a matter of fact, much of his initial research is still being taught at the Academy of Arcane Sciences.",
        "He was kicked out of the Academy for his practices and vowed revenge upon all of Freeport.  He ventured out into the Commonlands and continued his research, taking up residence in a tower made from bone.  As time went on, he eventually remodeled the tower into a more contemporary design, one fashioned from old stones he specially selected.",
        "Not exactly.  A hundred years ago, undead started appearing in much greater frequency in the Commonlands.  This alarmed the Academy to the point that they convinced the Militia to stop his threat by force.  When they arrived at his tower, he was gone.  The story goes, that when they searched the place, they found evidence proving he had been gone for a number of decades.",
        "Or so the Academy believed ... they just wrote it off to the undead venturing out from the Kithicor Forest.  There was once a forest to the west of the Commonlands before the Shattering.  Now that a decade has passed since the Shattering ended, my... benefactors... wish to continue their research into the mysterious disappearance of Zarvonn.",
        "It would be best if I didn't mention them.  The less you know, the safer you are.  I hate them with a seething passion, and if I still had my strength I'd slit every one of their throats ... who am I kidding ... I'm powerless against them. They own me more than any thrall could ever be owned.",
        "Yes, back to what I was saying.  They feel that Zarvonn is still around ... somewhere.  According to the information I was given, they think there is truth to his promise, and that he will return.  The recent return of the undead is making them think he's still alive and is about to follow through with his vow.",
        "I found an old manuscript of his that detailed his attempts at reanimating dead bodies, which ultimately led me to a dark, dark place.  Unfortunately, it was a false lead.  All I gained from that place was this wasting sickness. But I do believe the nomads may know more.",
        "The nomads have been in the Commonlands longer than anyone can remember, at least four hundred years, according to my research.  I found an old scroll that hinted that they may have come from the Thundering Steppes.  Their oral tradition of history through story telling may reveal more.  I have no plans on pursuing this matter anymore, though.  I accept my fate, and don't expect to leave this tower until I've taken my final breath.",
        "While I was pursuing my original assignment, I came across an old manuscript that I traced back to being penned by Zarvonn, the Mad Mage.  It took me a great while to translate it, but it seems he was researching how to reanimate dead bodies using the flesh of others.",
        "I'm not too sure about that anymore.  I think he was trying to make something different, but wound up using Necromancy rather than whatever other force he was using to create his original versions.  In his research, he was using specimens that already existed, but weren't undead.  I can attest to that from first hand experience.",
        "I tracked down where he found his original test subjects, and it led me into the Nektulos Forest.  It seems the \"golems\" he was originally using were coming from a mysterious manor, more a castle, actually.  I wasn't able to find out too much about the origins of the place, but it surely wasn't Teir'Dal in origin.",
        "There's a rather lengthy story to the whole place, but I'm not sure what to believe anymore, considering what I saw in there.  Apparently, the place is called Nektropos Castle, and was originally built by someone named Everling.  This was so long ago that the facts have been lost through time.  Maybe some of the Teir'Dal that live in that dark forest might know more, but I already know more than I want to.",
        "I wasn't able to find out if Zarvonn ever moved to Nektropos Castle, but if he did, he'd be dead by now.  That place is crawling with golems, and I'm certain malevolent spirits roam those halls.  I don't know if my sickness came from those golems, the spirits, or even something more ... frightening.  Look, I don't want to talk about this anymore.  If my benefactors want to know more about Zarvonn's tower, they can go speak with the nomads.",
        "I don't know where we can find them.They have a tendency of moving around for whatever crazy reason they have in their heads.  The last I heard, they set up camp in the north.  Mind you, there are two different tribes that roam the Commonlands.  The ones I find to be a bit more friendly are led by an old woman by the name of Gierasa.  Now leave me to die in peace."

        "That the orcs are more stupid than we thought. The elixir they create is triggered whenever the orc's adrenaline gets high enough. When this happens it actually eats away at the orc's brain! This damages the orc permanently. This is, of course, perfect.",

        "Rainus Canton, a once wandering sword now bound in service to the Overlord. And yourself?",
        "<player name>, indeed. Your name has graced the lips of many I have had the fortune--or misfortune--to listen to. It is a, ehm--a pleasure to meet you. Are you out here in the service of the Overlord as well?",
        "Splendid. Perhaps you would care to join me in earning his favor.",
        "Captain Feralis has been tasked with re-confirming the orc threat to Freeport. No, that doesn't mean we fear they could ever bring the city down, but even a gnat can annoy and pester. Feralis has asked me to help him, and I have agreed.",
        "Harassing the Bloodskulls, of course! And in doing so learning of their strengths and weaknesses. I've found them typical, so far. But one thing does stand out, their reliance on a thick root that grows around here.",
        "Bloodskull Frenzy Root. The Bloodskull shamans provide their orcs with a solution that combines with the root to create an elixir that sends the orcs into a rage once they're in combat. All the tests we've run on the weed have so far turned up nothing and we've run out of samples. Care to lend a hand?",
        "Head west of here. Once you find the orcs, pay your respects to the Overlord: kill some of the Bloodskull warriors and priests. However, and this is the important part, I would also like some samples of the Frenzy Root. The shaman mixture we have, don't worry about that, but bring me at least five root samples.",
        "Return to me once this is done, I'll have more work for you.",
        "Have you done as I asked?",
        "Good work, <player name>. I'll get these to our alchemist for study.",
        "That's right. I believe the orcs in this region are acting without new orders, they seem to be somewhat stagnant, or at the very least slow. They either have an inept leader or an absent one. I'd like you to head to the ruined towers west of here. There are some Bloodskull tower guards, kill them and search the corpses for the standing orders for these Bloodskull orcs. I'd like to see what they're working toward, if anything.",
        "While you do that maybe we can figure out how better to unlock the power of this root. Good luck!",
        "Did you slay the orcs and get the orders?",
        "Wonderful. Unfortunately we still don't have any word on the root.",
        "Give me a moment, the orcs aren't known for their grammar.",
        "It looks like these are orders to build up a \"cha nu durk.\" Which is--I think--the minimum size of a orc fighting unit.",
        "Carnage, no doubt. Orcs always wear their hearts upon their sleeves. The only thing a force that small would be useful for is routing civilians... Maybe a hit and run force for the Crossroads... ah hah!",
        "I read the orcs as books. They've two camps south-west of the Crossroads, just south of the kerran and ratonga villages. The orcs of these two camps will likely make up the cha nu durk... Kill the orcs and destroy their supplies. If they have a siege tower, destroy it as well.",
        "It's just a theory, but if they harass the kerrans and ratongans enough it may attract some militia attention. If that is their goal, perhaps they're looking to attack the Crossroads. If that isn't their plan, I am near certain they are going after the villagers, so put a stop to them regardless. We can't have the orcs killing civilians, who would we tax otherwise, eh?",

They brought down a building on Raegnir's entire crew and an unlucky guard captain. If you've found a part of his blade then perhaps you can be the one to return it to him.",

Press your advantages, <player name>, that's what I always say. Speaking of which, while you're there I would like you to find the Ree encampment. Once there, find a current copy of their orders.

        "Treasure hunting. Their orders are to seek out some sort of ancient Shin'Ree box. It appears one of their agents already had it in his possession. He buried it for safe keeping but was slain. However, it would seem he expected death and had word delivered to his people, though he didn't mention its exact location.",
        "They list it simply as \"useful.\" I don't know what that means to the orcs specifically, but I would prefer they didn't have it. The orders mention a shipment landing at the Blackshield Docks. I imagine the shipment will lead us to this package before the orcs...",
        "Two ways, both involving the orc courier. I am not sure precisely how old these orders are, but the sooner we act the better. Find the runner of Ree. If he is on his way to the docks then kill him and take the shipping receipt. Use it to get the package from the docks. If you catch the runner on the way from the docks then he will have the shipment, in which case you can take it directly from him. He'll be somewhere between the Ree camp west of here and the docks.",

        "Did you get the shipment?",
        "Excellent work.  If I am right this will tell us where the orc buried this \"useful\" treasure. Give me a moment, please.",
        "Perfect. It's somewhere near the Nektulos Station griffin tower, west of here. Go find it, dig it up, and bring it back to me.",
        "\"Useful,\" bah, my illiterate grandmother could write better than that.",
        "Did you get it?",
        "Aye. I've read more of the Ree orders. This is an old relic from the Shin'Ree clan. Apparently the \"key\" to opening it was, \"...a Shin'Ree orc with bloodied hand.\"",
        "I'm afraid it's not that simple.",
        "Well, orc magic is simplistic but it isn't something we can simply ignore. If the key to this chest is the bloodied hand of a Shin'Ree orc then that is what we must find. The skeletal orcs outside of the Wailing Caves are what's left of the Shin'Ree orcs. Among them you can find blood stained bones... which means hands. Unfortunately I doubt any of the skeletal orcs have preserved their bloody hands for us. But there is still a way.",
        "We can build a bloody hand ourselves! Slay the Shin'Ree orcs. Among their fallen bones collect the bloodied fingers--enough to form a hand. That will fulfill the needs of this orc spell, I am certain.",
        "Indeed you will, then you will see what spoils we reap in such jobs as these.",
        "Do you have the fingers?",
        "Yeah, yeah. Maybe next time we won't be so unlucky. Anyway, I neglected to mention this earlier--after all I wanted to get as much from you as I could--but Feralis has been asking for you. You should go speak with him, I believe he has another underling who could use your help.",
        "Hurry off now, Feralis has been expecting you.",
        "I've heard of your deeds. Good show. You learn fast, I can tell.",
        "These nomads can be quite pleasant to deal with.",
        "Overlord protect us!",
        "Good, good... Opening it should be as simple as... yes! A sash?... worthless. And under it? ...paper... The Code of the Shin'Ree? Useful? USEFUL? It's nothing but PAPER!Still, I suppose it isn't a complete waste. I guess some historian would part with some gold to have it. Alas, <player name>, I am sorry for the disappointment.
