        "Unfortunately, yes. You see, there are owlbear eggs in Nektulos, which is what most of my competitors have been trying to harvest and sell. These eggs have already started growing, however, which makes them worthless. If you buy one of these owlbear chicks, they will grow as usual. However, if you capture an egg just as it's been laid then my secret process can be applied which prevents the chick from growing! That's what Millie is doing right now.",

They allow both lone adventurers and groups of allies to combine their attacks into a series of spells or combat arts performed in a specific order. When successful, Heroic Opportunities give beneficial effects such as extra attacks against your foes or beneficial magic to heal or enhance your abilities.",

All you need to do is use your ability that triggers the Heroic Opportunity, then use the spells or combat arts that are blinking on your hotbar or in your Knowledge Book. Easy, isn't it?",
        "Heroic Opportunities have two parts called the Starter Chain and the Combat Wheel. At level 5, every adventure class gains an ability that triggers a Starter Chain: Fighting Chance, Divine Providence, Arcane Augur, or Lucky Break. Open your Knowledge book by pressing K and click the Abilities tab to see it. You can drag its icon to your hotbar to use it.",
        "Starter Chains can only be triggered while in battle with an enemy. After all, Heroic Opportunities are all about becoming great in combat! When you or an ally triggers a Starter Chain, you will see it appear in the corner of your screen.",
        "Once a Starter Chain is initiated, it shows different ability icons flashing on the screen. A Starter Chain will generally display four different icons that indicate which spells or combat arts advance the Heroic Opportunity to the next stage. Icons will be blue, yellow, red, or green, depending on which class has the ability.",
        "Heroic Opportunities can be used alone or in groups. If you fight alone you will have a limited number of ways to advance the Starter Chain, but if you are in a group made up of different classes then you will be able to advance the Starter Chain in different ways to unleash a variety of Heroic Opportunities.",
        "Any spells or combat arts that can advance the Heroic Opportunity will flash on your hotbar and in your Knowledge Book. You have 10 seconds to complete the Starter Chain and advance to the Combat Wheel. See, it's easy: just use the spell or art that blinks!",
        "It's quite simple. After you've advanced the Starter Chain, the bright and colorful Combat Wheel appears. The Combat Wheel shows a series of icons and displays the name of the Heroic Opportunity you have triggered. A Starter Chain will initiate one of three different Heroic Opportunities.",
        "There are three potential Heroic Opportunities: common, uncommon and rare. Each provides a different benefit. Though even the common ones are valuable, the rare event can sometimes turn the tide of battle in your favor!",
        "As with the Starter Chain, the Combat Wheel indicates which spells or arts must be performed to advance and eventually complete the heroic event. Sometimes these spells or abilities must be performed in a particular order. Other times there is no order.",
        "In the very center of the Wheel, you'll see either a clockwise-pointing arrow or arrows pointing in different directions. The clockwise arrow indicates that the abilities must be completed in order. The other types of arrows mean that the abilities can be completed in any order.",
        "The Combat Wheel must be completed within 10 seconds or the Opportunity will fail. The blue bar that appears around the outside of the Wheel is a timer. When the blue bar is gone, this indicates that time has run out to complete the Heroic Opportunity.",

Mages, on the other hand, know they can't take much punishment anyway, so would rather have armor that provides nice attribute bonuses.",

White names indicate the opponent is even with your abilities. Yellow names mean the fight will be challenging. Orange names indicate a difficult encounter. Red names mean the battle could be deadly.",

        "No arrow by the target's name indicates an average opponent for a lone adventurer. A single down arrow means it is a below average opponent. Two down arrows tell you it's a weak opponent, and three down arrows means it is very weak. Be careful though, because if multiple weak opponents are working together they can still represent quite a challenge.",
        "Up arrows indicate increased difficulty. A single up arrow means an above average opponent. Two up arrows show a strong opponent, while three up arrows means a very tough fight. If you look at the sparring partners next to us, you will see that they have different arrow indicators. Feel free to practice fighting them to feel what effect the arrows have.",
        "As a general rule of thumb, if you see an enemy with one up arrow, it's a good idea to team up with another player to take it on. If you see an enemy with two up arrows, add two members to your group. If you see an opponent with three up arrows, add three members to your group. A lone adventurer will likely want to face targets with no arrows or down arrows.",

        "Harvestables are natural resources that can be found around most parts of the outdoors.  You have harvesting skills that allow you collect them. These can be seen by opening your Character window (C), clicking on the Skills tab, and selecting the General skills. Rocks increase mining, logs increase foresting, dens increase trapping, fish increase fishing, and shrubs increase gathering.",
        "The items found through harvesting are the basic building blocks of tradeskills.  They cannot be sold to vendors, but they can be traded or sold to other players who need them for their respective tradeskill professions.  Some components that can be found through harvesting are very rare and can be worth quite a bit of money to tradeskillers.",
        "The skill required to harvest in a given area increases along with the difficulty of the area.  If you find that you are unable to harvest in an area you should return to a less difficult area and practice.",
        "It is bothersome, but I have seen worse. That is why I love collections so much. It helps me to forget..."
