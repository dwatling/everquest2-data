They haven't been openly hostile as of yet, but sending out patrols at this point would certainly not be a good plan, given our small numbers. If the dwarves view us as trespassers, it could be disastrous for us.",

Unfortunately, our numbers here are fairly small, and we don't have anyone who might be able to begin the negotiations necessary.  I know this probably isn't normally what you do, but might you be available for hire?",

I know she has worked with Emissary Raghuntha, and might be more amicable to our offer.  Perhaps if you can perform deeds for others on the docks, it will show the dwarves that we are serious about our offer for cooperation.  And I'm sure there will be plenty of reward in it for you, too."
