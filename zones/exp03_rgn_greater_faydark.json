If arrows also appear above the heads of nearby creatures, it means all of them are linked together and will attack as one.",
        "Sometimes multiple creatures will work together to form a single encounter. These opponents will act as a team, and usually won't stop fighting until all of them are defeated.",
        "The Target window tells you several important facts, which collectively form what is referred to as the \"con\" (overall challenge) of the opponent. It shows you the numerical level of the creature you have targeted, a color to indicate its relative level range, up or down arrows to indicate toughness, and indicators that tell you if the encounter is normal, heroic, or epic.",
        "As you adventure through Norrath, you will gain experience and increase your level. The opponents you will face in combat have levels as well. To be victorious, you will usually want to face foes that are close to your level.",
        "You gain more experience by defeating higher-level opponents, but they will also be tougher to beat. Conversely, if you defeat foes much lower than your level, they will not be nearly as rewarding.",
        "The color of your opponent's name indicates how challenging the encounter is. It is very useful as a quick indicator of whether or not you should be fighting a target. The more danger its color indicates, the greater the threat it represents.",
        "Grey names mean the fight is below your abilities and will give no experience or reward. Green names mean the opponent is very easy. Blue names mean an easy fight. White names indicate the opponent is even with your abilities. Yellow names mean the fight will be challenging. Orange names indicate a difficult encounter. Red names mean the battle could be deadly.",
        "Targets with grey names will not attack you, even if they would be aggressive to someone closer to their level. In other words, you won't be attacked by anything that won't give you some reward for defeating it.",
        "No arrow by the target's name indicates an average opponent for a lone adventurer. A single down arrow means it is a below average opponent. Two down arrows tell you it's a weak opponent, and three down arrows means it is very weak. Be careful though, because if multiple weak opponents are working together they can still represent quite a challenge.",
        "Up arrows indicate increased difficulty. A single up arrow means an above average opponent. Two up arrows show a strong opponent, while three up arrows means a very tough fight. If you look at the sparring partners next to us, you will see that they have different arrow indicators. Feel free to practice fighting them to feel what effect the arrows have.",
        "As a general rule of thumb, if you see an enemy with one up arrow, it's a good idea to team up with another player to take it on. If you see an enemy with two up arrows, add two members to your group. If you see an opponent with three up arrows, add three members to your group. A lone adventurer will likely want to face targets with no arrows or down arrows.",
        "A normal opponent has no indicator and is intended to be fought by a solo adventurer or small group. A heroic encounter is intended for a larger group of up to six adventurers. An epic opponent should only be attempted by a raid force of multiple groups working together.",
        "All the elements I've explained will affect the outcome of a battle and whether or not you will need allies to win. Pay close attention to the lessons I have taught you, and apply them to challenges you face throughout your journeys in Norrath. Learn well and you will indeed become the great champion I know you can be!"
