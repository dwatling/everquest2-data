        "Greetings, adventurer. What business do you have here?",
        "I suppose formal introductions are in order. I am Inquisitor Thorson, sent by my masters in the Dismal Rage to investigate a recent increase in undead activity here.",
        "The Dismal Rage looks after the spiritual needs of Freeport's people. We congregate in the Temple of War in North Freeport. We are made up largely of priests, though we do employ other professions from time to time.",
        "Though in ancient times our priests served the old gods, we no longer bow to such archaic symbols of authority. Today the Dismal Rage serves the Overlord and our high priestess, Xilania Nevagon.",
        "Some of us believe it was not the gods themselves that were the true power, but rather the planar forces they represented. The ancient gods were symbols, the embodiment of the principles we now serve.",
        "We draw our power from many sources, including the principles of Hate, Fear, War, and Decay. There are sects within the Dismal Rage dedicated to all these ideals and more, though we are united in our service to the Overlord and High Priestess Nevagon.",
        "You have arrived in the Sunken City, once a thriving district of Freeport. Now it stands as a monument to the madness of those who would have sacrificed our beloved city to the waves.",
        "I will tell you more if you want to hear it, but first I must review the notes I have been taking on what I have observed since my arrival here. To learn a bit more about this place, go through the archway just ahead and speak to an iksar named Saydith Yarr.",
        "Excellent. Return to me after you have spoken to him.",
        "Did you speak to Saydith Yarr?",
        "Saydith has been here a long time, and I think he has gone a bit mad. I can tell you more about this place if you like, or we can skip all that and you can do some work for me.",
        "What we now call the Sunken City was once a residential district in the northern section of Freeport known affectionately by its residents as Plank's Edge. It was home to many of the sailors and merchants that worked on the docks of East Freeport's bustling shipping trade.",
        "As was typical of a seafaring community, many of the residents worshiped Prexus, the Ocean Lord. Though a boisterous and sometimes rowdy bunch, they lived peaceably enough with the other citizens of Freeport.",
        "When the Rending began and the seas became impassible, Freeport's harbor fell on hard times. Shipping and trade ground to a halt and the fishing industry collapsed. East Freeport became a ghost town, known more for its crime than for its commerce.",
        "In this climate of fear and uncertainty, a half elven extremist named Elwyn Aquel gained a following. He preached that Prexus was angry with Freeport, and only through the hard work and sacrifice of his followers would the seas calm and prosperity return.",
        "Aquel's followers, called the Circle of Darkfathom, quickly rose in prominence among the disgruntled citizens of Plank's Edge. Aquel promised brighter days to these desperate people on the brink of losing everything they had.",
        "Little did the people of Plank's Edge know that they had fallen victim to a madman's scheme. The sacrifice Aquel spoke of was a literal one: he intended to sink Freeport to the bottom of the ocean in a twisted scheme to gain favor with Prexus. He believed that the flood waters would wash away the city and grant him immortality in the process.",
        "It was only as Aquel began his ritual of sacrifice that some of his followers saw through his deception. As the ground beneath Plank's Edge began to sink and the flood waters came pouring in, some of the Darkfathom members interrupted Aquel's incantation and broke the spell. Though Freeport was saved, it was too late for the people of Plank's Edge, who drowned beneath the unholy tide. Aquel's body was never recovered.",
        "Thankfully the high walls around the outside of the district held strong, so damage to neighboring parts of Freeport was minimal. Gradually the waters receded but never fully went away, leaving the area all but unlivable. Abandoned by the city's residents, Plank's Edge is now called the Sunken City, a dangerous place haunted by the souls of those who met their doom within.",
        "The Sunken City is haunted, by both the spirits of those innocents who died here and by the fallen Prexians who caused this catastrophe. It is said that there are even more spirits who walk these flooded streets after night falls.",
        "When the undead are defeated and their spirits are freed, they often leave behind a spectral essence that, if properly analyzed, reveals much about their past. I must find out what is causing the increase in activity among the undead. I need you to obtain four spectral essences from the undead creatures.",
        "The undead walk just ahead, though some lurk a bit farther in. Remember, more of these ghastly creatures can be found after night falls. Return to me when you have their essences.",
        "Hello again. Do you have the spectral essences I asked you to obtain?",
        "Well done! These essences will aid in my research. It will take me some time to study them. While I do that, it may be a good idea for you to have a look around and discover some of the other inhabitants of the Sunken City.",
        "This place is home to more than just the spirits of those who died here. I've been told there are a few types of vermin scattered around the Sunken City, and I'd like you to confirm their presence for me.",
        "Crabs like to roam in shallow water, so I need a rough estimate of their density here. You should find plenty of brine sifters just through the archway, as well as farther on to the east.",
        "Though a coastal city, Freeport has a very arid climate. Scorpions may be found here on some of the dry portions of ground. You might try going west, then south a bit.",
        "Of particular interest to me are the strange rust monsters that scurry around here. There is little information on where they come from, but they showed up in this area after the destruction caused by the Rending. They get their name not only for their brownish color, but for their odd taste for consuming rusty metal. If any of your gear becomes rusty due to the moisture here, be on your guard.",
        "The Knowledge Book you obtained on the Outpost of the Overlord contains many Abilities that will prove useful to you. Among these Abilities is one called Catalogue Creature. If you draw close to a creature, you can use this ability to obtain information about it. Everything I need to know will be recorded in your Quest Journal. There is no need to attack any of these creatures, simply use the Catalogue Creature ability on them.",
        "For the safety of Freeport, we must uncover the truth of this place.",
        "Greetings once again. Have you studied the local wild creatures?",
        "Well done! Your reputation as a hard worker is well earned. It seems there is no shortage of life here in the Sunken City, even if most of it scuttles about in the shadows.",
        "I am not the only one sent here by the Dismal Rage. Some of my allies have ventured deeper into the Sunken City. In fact, since I have completed my examination of the spectral essences you obtained, I need you to take the information to one of them.",
        "Seek out Investigator Curfeld, a highly respected member of our order. He has spent a lot of time researching the events that transpired here, and no doubt has some insight into the recent rise in undead activity. Take my findings on the spectral essences and give them to him.",
        "You can find Investigator Curfeld by going north through the archway, then west and south. He stands past the scorpions you discovered near the gateway to the Graveyard. He knows that additional help is coming, so tell him that I sent you.",
        "We must all act to defend Freeport.",
        "Thank you for assisting the Dismal Rage in investigating the Sunken City. Has Investigator Curfeld made any crucial discoveries?",
        "Ah, thank you. I am glad to have someone of his expertise in charge of these matters. I will look through his journal as I prepare to return to North Freeport to present my report. If I may ask, what did the investigator have you do?",
        "Pirates, eh? I'd heard rumors of their kind stashing their goods around here. I guess they figured no one would go looking for stolen goods in a place that is haunted by the spirits of the past. I assume he asked you to report their activity to the Freeport Militia.",
        "Documents? Well, surely Investigator Curfeld knows what's best. What else did he ask you to do?",
        "The ruins of that ancient shrine are certainly cursed. No doubt he asked you to destroy the shrine and sanctify the ground.",
        "What? I don't understand it. Why would he not want the shrine destroyed, especially if it still has arcane power? Let me see if he explains it in this journal.",
        "Wait... what is going on? This journal isn't about ending the threat of the undead and keeping Freeport safe. It contains notes on how to recreate the spell used by Elwyn Aquel and the Circle of Darkfathom to destroy our city!",
        "I'd heard it said that members of the investigator's family were worshipers of Prexus. They must have been members of the Circle of Darkfathom. Our city is in grave danger! We have to stop him!",
        "There's no time to waste! Curfeld must not be allowed to complete this unholy ritual. The safety of Freeport itself is at stake! Go back and face him. You must put an end to his foul scheme before all is lost.",
        "You have my full authority to take whatever action is necessary. Fear not; I will ensure that the high priestess and the rest of the Dismal Rage know that your actions were necessary to save our city. Do this, and not only will you be rewarded but your fame will grow. Hurry, go!"
