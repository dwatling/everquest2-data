        "Hmmmm, and who might you be? Come forward so I can look upon you, stranger.",
        "Ah, yes. You look exactly how you were described to me.",
        "Oh come now, it's not often that the name of an adventurer of your stature passes outside of the districts, although it comes as no surprise to me that you have already risen above these other, lesser beings.",
        "You mean to tell me you've never heard of me? Well, I shouldn't expect a common adventurer such as you to associate with people of my social status, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.",
        "Allow me to introduce myself. I am Zaddar, herald of the arcane, necromancer and custodian to the great library within the Academy of Arcance Science. I can assure you that you will meet none greater, no matter where your various exploits take you on Norrath.",
        "This is not just a simple graveyard, mind you. There are more than just Freeport citizens buried here; this is where the enemies of the Overlord are entombed as well. You mean to tell me you were not aware of this?",
        "I wouldn't trust anyone but a loyal follower of the Overlord with the task before me, I'm sure you understand. Normally I'd take care of such things myself, but these duties are far below my level of expertise and intellect. What do you say?",
        "Good, I knew you would make the smart choice. Go check on the tombs of the fallen knights, make sure they're all still sealed and that grave robbers have not disturbed any of the mausoleums.",
        "The Overlord will have us both executed if he finds out anyone has been tampering with the tombs in his graveyard! Report back with what you discover.",
        "Back so soon? I certainly hope you didn't just sneak off somewhere and take a nap. The Overlord is not to be trifled with!",
        "I am pleased to hear that you fulfilled my request. Was there any trouble?",
        "Skeleton attacks are not uncommon in the Graveyard, as you have discovered. I presume this was just some ordinary fiend?",
        "Fascinating! The Overlord was wise to have us check on the security of the tombs. I wonder if Varacus realizes what is transpiring here in the Graveyard.",
        "Varacus T`Kur is the leader of the Keepers of Ethernere here in the Graveyard. He has some pages of an ancient tome that should help in my research. Tell him that I sent you, and if he gives you any trouble, remind him that this errand comes from the Overlord himself passed down through the Academy.",
        "Go now, and return when you have the pages from Varacus.",
        "Ah, <player name>, I see you have returned. Have you brought back the pages you obtained from Varacus of the Keepers of Ethernere?",
        "Excellent work! Please give me the pages at once. There is no time to waste.",
        "Interested in hearing more of my tale, are you? As you recall, the fallen Knights of Truth are buried here in the Graveyard.",
        "Recently grave robbers have invaded the cemetery by night, breaking open the seals placed on the graves of the knights. This has enabled some of those cursed souls to rise and walk the land again.",
        "It does indeed. But there is a greater concern we must face, which is why I needed these pages.",
        "Long ago, our Overlord commanded the Foci and the priests of the Dismal Rage to place a powerful ward upon this graveyard. It bound the spirits of those buried here to this place, so that even if they escaped their tombs, they would be unable to leave the Graveyard.",
        "The binding spell was lost long ago. But the increase in undead activity may mean that someone loyal to Mithaniel Marr, or even the god himself, might be trying to shatter the ward and let the undead travel beyond these walls into the city itself.",
        "No one is certain what became of the ancient gods. It's best not to take chances in any case. It could be some fanatical follower of Marr behind this, or even those savages from the decrepit Kingdom of Qeynos.",
        "I'm sure some of the corrupt citizens of Qeynos are still loyal to Marr. By breaking the binding ward, the fallen Knights of Truth would be free to rise and seek revenge on our beloved Overlord. This cannot come to pass!",
        "Good, this is what I need done. I want you to take this ancient relic to the ruins of the Tower of Marr and place it in the doorway. The relic has been stained with the blood of the Knights of Truth and has been in the keeping of the Academy of Arcane Science since the day of that final battle.",
        "Yes, the remains of that tower still serve as a tribute to Mithaniel Marr. Such a relic would be seen as an abomination to him.",
        "Do not worry. The binding ward that keeps the undead here also prevents outside influences from entering the Graveyard and keeps any lingering energies in check. So long as the ward holds, you should be safe when you place that relic in the doorway.",
        "What could happen? The gods have been gone for centuries. You have proven yourself to be a brave hero of Freeport. Do not waver now!",
        "Spoken like a true citizen of Freeport! Listen, if you help me with this, I'll be sure you are rewarded for your efforts. The Academy will take notice of us both!",
        "Just take the relic and place it in the doorway. And whatever you do, don't lose it! It is an ancient artifact, and neither the Academy nor the Overlord would be pleased if it was misplaced.",
        "Welcome back, <player name>. I assume you concluded your investigation and found that the ward is still intact?",
        "This is dark news indeed. Marr blessed that tower long ago, and if some of that energy is now bleeding through, the ward is certainly weak. Fortunately I've already begun translating the parchment pages you found for me in case they were needed. Oh, I'll need that artifact back, by the way.",
        "While I finish the translation, I need you to help me once more. Are you willing?",
        "It is up to the two of us to restore the ward that keeps the undead confined to the Graveyard. This is our chance to save Freeport!",
        "There is no time to waste. True heroes must be prepared to rise to the occasion and embrace their destiny. You have a bold future ahead of you, <player name>. Now is the time to act!",
        "Fame and fortune, of course! The Academy is sure to take notice of you when I report to them of what has occurred here today. You may even be noticed by the Overlord himself, <player name>.",
        "I want you to go back to Varacus and the Keepers of Ethernere. Tell him that we need to restore the ward and that we need the Staff of Ethernere.",
        "This staff has runes carved along its length that ward off the undead. It is often used by the Keepers of Ethernere during purifying rituals.",
        "The Staff of Ethernere, when used along with the arcane power contained in the Book of the Dead, will help me repair the ward.",
        "Time is of the essence, <player name>. The ward may be fading faster than we realize and we must repair it!",
        "Have you obtained the Staff of Ethernere?",
        "Well done! I'm sure it was difficult to convince Varacus to part with it. But this is indeed the Staff of Ethernere.",
        "Do you see these runes inscribed upon it? They are written in the language of the dead. When spoken to the living, this language sounds like mere whispers, but to the undead it sounds as clear as how you and I are speaking now.",
        "Confront the local grave robbers and determine if one of them has obtained the Book of the Dead. The grave robbers tend to work at night, so begin your search then.",
        "Excellent. Return to me when you have found it.",
        "Have you found the Book of the Dead?",
        "Excellent work, <player name>! I must say, you are turning out to be quite a useful aide. You've done almost as well as if I had done this task myself! Now quickly, hand me the book.",
        "Look at how the parchment pages you retrieved are binding themselves inside the Book of the Dead! It truly is a mysterious and powerful tome. I will use the Staff of Ethernere during the ritual to focus the power of the spell we cast.",
        "I will tell you the ancient words of binding. You chant them, and I will repeat them after you. Only by working together can we complete the spell and save Freeport. Understood?",
        "I must read the words from the pages of parchment that are now within the Book of the Dead. They are difficult to decipher, even with my skills. Give me a moment to study them.",
        "I've managed to translate the words from the ancient pages you've attained for me. Shall we begin?",
        "The first words are \"Graddah, Shollamak, Hakah.\" Ready?",
        "Let the ritual begin!",
        "Graddah, Shollamak, Hakah!",
        "Something is wrong. The incantation will not take effect!",
        "Are you certain that all of the tombs of the Knights of Truth were sealed? If even one of them remains opened, it might prevent the binding ward from taking hold.",
        "<player name>, you must go to the tombs at once and verify that each seal is intact. This is the only way we can complete the ritual and renew the ward upon the Graveyard to keep the undead at bay. Hurry! The fate of Freeport is in your hands!",
        "The second set of words are, \"Golotu, Quandar, Gunoo.\"  Ready?",
        "Proceed!",
        "Golotu, Quandar, Gunoo!",
        "The final set of words are the most important. \"Waktana, Shollamak, Quandar, Hakah.\"  Here we go!",
        "Recite the words, <player name>.",
        "Waktana, Shollamak, Quandar, Hakah!",
        "Exellent job, <player name>! I think we've done it! I must admit, I doubt even I could have accomplished this task without your help.",
        "The enemies of the Overlord are thwarted, and the Knights of Truth shall remain bound to this graveyard for the rest of time.",
        "Your reward is well deserved. You have my thanks. Your name will be well known within the Academy of Arcane Science.",
        "Your assistance to the Academy of Arcane Science and Freeport has been invaluable. But now more help is needed from you. Freeport is not out of danger! You must take the knowledge you have learned here and travel to the Ruins. Are you willing?",
        "An outlying district of Freeport known as the Ruins is under attack. You must make your way there and report to Captain Arellius of the Freeport Militia. She will guide your efforts to help save our city.",
        "Make your way to the Ruins by traveling back to the docks of your home district. Use the mariner's bell to summon transportation outside of Freeport proper and ask to be taken to the Ruins. You should find Captain Arellius nearby. Hurry, hero of Freeport, there is no time to waste!",
        "Eager, aren't we? Well, I know some thug named Enforcer Kurdek in the Sprawl needs help, and a fellow named Inquisitor Thorson in the Sunken City could use a hand.",
        "Enforcer Kurdek on the Sprawl could use a hand keeping the local gangs in line. To journey to the Sprawl, use the mariner's bell on the docks of your home district to travel to Big Bend. Follow the halls north, then take the west passageway to the west gate.",
        "Inquisitor Thorson in the Sunken City needs help investigating ancient mysteries that threaten Freeport's safety. To travel to the Sunken City, use the mariner's bell on the docks of your home district to travel outside Freeport and choose Sunken City as your destination."

Ethernere is a dark realm of agony where spirits of the dead must travel. It is said that when a Norrathian dies, the bell in Deathtoll Tower at the heart of Ethernere rings to signal their spirit's arrival.",
