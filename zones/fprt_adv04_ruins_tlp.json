        "You've entered a war zone, citizen. The Freeport Militia is here in force to defend our city. Two orc clans seem to be working together in an attempt to take over the Ruins and use it as a staging ground to attack Freeport.",
        "You seem inexperienced.  Perhaps if you delivered something for me in the Commonlands, the journey would better prepare you for what lies beyond these walls. ",
        "Both tribes have been lurking in the Ruins for some time, but they've never been this aggressive before. They seem to have become more organized and have obtained better weapons and armor.",
        "The weaker of the two tribes is called the Brokentusk. The stronger clan is known as the Lonetusk. I don't know much about their background personally, but my lieutenants stationed in the field may have more information.",
        "Take a few steps inside the archway and you'll see why. This is an old section of Freeport that has long been abandoned. Its once stately manors and exclusive boutiques are now burned-out shells and broken walls.",
        "Oh yes. What we now call the Ruins was once known as Shoreside, an expensive and very exclusive residential district. It was favored by the wealthy for its ocean view and isolation from the hustle and bustle of the city, but the irony is that those very qualities led to its downfall.",
        "Freeport has come under attack many times, and our Militia maintains a strong presence in the Commonlands to fend off the Bloodskull orcs. During one particularly fierce battle, the bulk of our forces were committed to a frontal assault on the city gates.",
        "In an unusually clandestine move, the Brokentusk and Lonetusk tribes seized the opportunity to sneak into the Shoreside docks by nightfall. The cowardly beasts overpowered the small garrison left to defend the district, then proceeded to burn and pillage everything they found. Many noble citizens of Freeport died in that conflict.",
        "As I said, most of our troops were busy fighting in the Commonlands. By the time reinforcements could be sent, the damage had been done. Since Shoreside was isolated and difficult to defend, it was decided that there was no sense in rebuilding it. The Sprawl serves as a buffer between the Ruins and the city proper, so Freeport remains secure. Still, there was a heavy price to be paid.",
        "Even though the invaders were defeated, War Duke Eutarius, the high-ranking Militia officer who had been charged with the city's defense, was executed in the plaza for his incompetence and failure. The Overlord does not tolerate mistakes.",
        "The once exclusive Shoreside became the Ruins, a broken-down home to beggars and squatters. Some remnants of the orc tribes remained as well, but they were so weak and disorganized that they posed little threat. In fact, this was a relatively calm area until quite recently.",
        "I do not know, adventurer. Perhaps that is something you can help discover. But we must act quickly, lest these orcs rise up and do to the rest of Freeport what they once did to Shoreside.",
        "I must remain here to give assignments to incoming troops. Go through the archway and report to one of my lieutenants, Argosian. He will tell you how you can best serve our cause.",
        "Good. Oh, be sure to pay homage to the statue of our beloved Overlord. It would prove most beneficial for you to bask in the wisdom of his visage.",
        "Lieutenant Argosian at the first outpost will be responsible for your initial training. Do not return to me until he has ordered you to do so.",
        "The Freeport Militia will make a stand against these orcs!",
        "Hail, citizen of Freeport. I am told that you are currently in the service of Enforcer Kurdek, the Dreadnaught who dwells in the Sprawl.",
        "Kurdek informed me how you helped him keep the rival gangs of the Sprawl in check. The help of true heroes of Freeport like you is needed if we are to defend our city against this attack.",
        "Take this letter to Mooshga, an ogre who works in the Commonlands. Are you familiar with the area?",
        "Use the bell here on the docks to travel within Freeport and choose the City of Freeport as your destination. From there, travel through the city until you arrive at the main gate that leads to the Commonlands.",
        "Remember that the Commonlands can be a dangerous place. Judge your battles carefully, <player name>. When you gather allies and are ready to undertake the fight against the Lonetusk orcs, return here.",
        "More recruits are needed to man the barricades!",
        "Hail, Citizen of Freeport. I have been informed that you are in the service of Custodian Zaddar, that haughty Erudite from the Graveyard.",
        "Zaddar informed me how crucial your help was in repairing the ward in the Graveyard. The help of true heroes of Freeport like you is needed if we are to defend our city against this attack.",
        "To arms! The Ruins must be defended against these mindless brutes!",
        "Have you completed your assignments for Lieutenant Argosian at the first outpost?",
        "Good work! Did you find out what's behind this increase in orc activity?",
        "At least we can rule that out, but clearly further investigation is required. Here, help yourself to your choice of equipment from our supply chests. You should find something that will be of use in our continued efforts against the orc uprising.",
        "The next step in our investigation will be an arduous one. Although to this point you could journey alone, some parts of the Ruins can be deadly for the lone adventurer.",
        "I knew you were daring!  My advice is to gather some comrades and form a group. There is safety in numbers, especially in places like this. As you venture further out into the world, you will find groups to be extremely helpful in achieving your goals.",
        "To be honest, I could tell that the Brokentusk were too weak to be behind the recent attacks. They have always followed the lead of their more powerful brethren, the Lonetusk orcs.",
        "Yes, the Lonetusk are much more deadly. They are more inclined to work together, and this will require a strong group of adventurers to stand against them.",
        "I need you to report to Lieutenant Imperidus, who is stationed at the second Militia outpost deeper in the Ruins. It is located to the west of here, near the gate to the Sprawl. She is heading up the Lonetusk investigation.",
        "Again, keep in mind that even travel to the second outpost will be dangerous. Travel with companions to ensure your safety. Do not report back to me until you have followed the lieutenant's orders.",
        "Hail, citizen of Freeport. I've heard that you have been sent here by Inquisitor Thorson, the officer of the Dismal Rage who is stationed in the Sunken City.",
        "Thorson informed me how you helped uncover Curfeld's plot to destroy Freeport. The help of true heroes of Freeport like you is needed if we are to defend our city against this attack.",
        "We must avenge the fallen of Shoreside!"

        "Based on the change that has come over these orcs, I think something is afoot.",
        "The Militia didn't pay much attention to the Brokentusk until very recently. They were a pathetically weak clan, made up of mostly outcasts of the Bloodskull orcs in the Commonlands. But it seems they have new armor and stronger weapons, and seem to be on the move.",
        "Not yet. My scouts have reported overhearing the orcs say that their prophets are guarding some kind of shrine deeper in the Ruins. I'd like to rule out any sort of divine influence, so I need you to find out whether or not this shrine actually exists. Are you willing?",

        "Hello again, orc slayer. Did you find the shrine I ordered you to look for?",
        "Well, good work in any case. What is the purpose of the shrine?",
