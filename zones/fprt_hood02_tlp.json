        "It is said that all Erudites on Odus set aside their differences some time before the great wars and the Shattering.  The combined forces of the Heretics and disciples of Erud ventured to the Stonebrunt Mountains and built their fortress of tranquility and fear.",
        "Hehe, indeed, my friend.  The citadel was designed to hold the temple to each of the patron deities these societies revered.  The Erudites tried to conceal their work from the world beneath this citadel.  However, history would not allow our ancestors to be so passive and unassuming.",
        "Our ancestors took to sabotaging the citadel's construction during the night.  It was when the Erudites stationed more guards that the ancestors were  forced to dig beneath the site. That was how they discovered the truth behind the Erudites' efforts.",
        "The Erudites had constructed a base of concentrated arcane power that was obviously the foundation and core of their plans.  Fearing another catastrophic event engineered at the hands of careless Erudite meddling, the ancestors took sanctuary on Kerra Isle, abandoning their homeland to the inevitable fate of the continent. ",
        "What happened shortly after the ancestors' retreat was both awesome and frightful.  Nearly a week after the retreat, on the onset of dawn, a great sound echoed from the continent like the song of a thousand great whales.  Within a few moments, the sound went still and all was suddenly quiet...",
        "A cloud of mist radiated from the north, enshrouding the entirety of the continent and the surrounding shores in a thick, shimmering veil of impenetrable fog.  All grew eerily quiet. This phenomenon lasted by a few short minutes before the mists retreated.",
        "No, Odus remained, and to the surprise of those who bore witness, it was as if nothing had occurred.  The forests of Toxxulia remained and the snow-capped peaks of Stonebrunt could be seen upon the northern horizon.  However, all remained silent and deathly still for the days that would pass.",
        "None dared to tread upon the land, believing it was now cursed or fouled by the Erudites' magic.  As the first of the silent days passed, many came to accept that the Erudites had destroyed themselves and all living creatures upon the continent.  A lunar cycle would pass before our ancestors learned otherwise.",
        "They saw the Erudites much as we see them now.  Their altered forms frightened many, warding the ancestors from the continent for many generations to come.  What magics occurred beneath the mist are a mystery.  The Erudites will not share this tale openly with most, for we think that they too are without answers to their mysterious transformation."
