We were ordered to remain on patrol and guard the sewer entrances, but there were no more sightings. It was quiet for a few days after that. The patrol remained on alert and we all worked triple shifts, but the damage was done.",
        "What a logical conclusion that would be, eh? But no, she did not kill them.  Apparently, she conceded to the vermin ambassadors' requests and an audience was arranged with the Overlord. Official orders welcoming the ratonga race into the city's populace were posted and before the ink could dry, the streets were flooded with the vermin, as if they had been there, invisible, all along.",
