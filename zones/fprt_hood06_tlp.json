We thought the Green Mist was a blessing from the patron Thule, but recent occurrences have proved this great blessing has not been entirely extinguished.",

Instead, they were met with a field of blistered corpses.  ",

The power of the mist is still with us, and it will be our key to ascension!",

This mist will come again and justice will be delivered once more.  There is no escape from it!  Embrace the inevitability of our rise!",
        "I am only certain of our fate and what history has shown.  The mists are favorable to us; why, I do not know.  Unlike the empires past, the second rising of our imperial reign will not be weak or foolishly arrogant!  It will serve in respect to the greater powers of this existence that can be neither fathomed nor controlled!"

        "Greetings. I am Ugarin, lone wolf of the north winds. I am the preserver of the lost lore of the true Halasians.",
        "The Halasians were the champions of the frozen realms. They were the first barbarians to truly defy the gods of frost. The Halasians built the grandest city of all,  The city of Halas. It was a city of refuge amidst the magnificence of the frozen tundra and its many dangers.",
        "Halas is no more. Having survived the furies of E`ci, the eternal rage of the ice dragon Vox, and even the massive assaults during the Age of War, it would be the Shattering that brought doom  to the city. Many lives were lost, a city toppled, and with that, the horns of Halas would bellow out no more.",
        "A true Halasian? They're rare, but they do exist. You can tell who they are by the glare in their eyes. A glare that was burned into their eyes as they watched in horror as loved ones were crushed beneath the rain of Luclin and the toppling walls of Halas.",
        "Perhaps. Or perhaps my eyes have seen too many horrors that swept across all of Norrath. Some say the gods have been silenced. I say we should think first of the many Empires that have been silenced. Friend or foe. Vast or humble. All were silenced.",
        "I did not say destroyed. I said silenced. We the survivors of the Age of Cataclysms huddle within the few cities of refuge. We have had no contact nor heard any word of the lost empires. It is likely they are destroyed, but we must explore the Shattered Lands to answer this.",
        "The wintry lands are no more. Think only of the uncharted territory beyond the gates. This land has been shattered and reformed. Much is unknown. Leave Halas to memories."
