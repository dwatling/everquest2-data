I need you to give a merchant friend of mine a little reminder of a certain debt she owes.  If you're interested, I'll give you her name and location.  There may be a little coin in it for you, if you return with the response I'm looking for.",

Preface that with this: Any wrong answer will result in a visit from the Butcher.  Be sure to sneer during that part.  Hurry off now.  I'll be waiting on you."
