I need you to give a merchant friend of mine a little reminder of a certain debt she owes.  If you're interested, I'll give you her name and location.  There may be a little coin in it for you, if you return with the response I'm looking for.",

You're looking for Julia Florens of the Jade Tiger's Den in North Freeport.  Just ask her when she's going to pay me.  Preface that with this: Any wrong answer will result in a visit from the Butcher.  Be sure to sneer during that part.  Hurry off now.  I'll be waiting on you."
