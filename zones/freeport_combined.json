        "Allow me to greet you in the name of our mighty Overlord, Lucan.  It is through his leadership and wisdom that the walls of Freeport are kept standing, and that our enemies are kept at bay.",
        "And why shouldn't I?  Is it not clear that powers beyond this world flow through him?  Remember that in the absence of the gods, Lucan D'Lere rebuilt this city and made it into a beacon of salvation for those who would otherwise had been lost during the Age of Cataclysms.",
        "You border on treasonous statements, and you are lucky none of his Lucanic Knights are nearby.  Of COURSE the city fell into chaos.  The Overlord is the one who maintains the order of Freeport.  None can replace him here – we have all seen what happens when Lucan is no longer here to watch over the city.",
        "Ah, and that is a story of his unparalleled wisdom.",
        "When Lucan D'Lere returned to Freeport after his absence, one of the first things he recognized is that his city was comprised of a people whose will was close to broken.  Their faith was strained, and they had no guidance.  Their resentment was growing.",
        "Of course he could – Freeport belongs to Lucan D'Lere alone.  But further oppression of an already breaking people could lead to revolt.  Freeport did not need back-to-back incursions, especially not one in the middle of rebuilding from the last one.  No, the answer was not brute force.",
        "He reasoned that the people needed to have their faith renewed.  That by showing them that he and he alone would care for and look after him, showing them that his strength was their strength, and that he was the one true leader of Freeport, he might quell any insurrection that could be brewing.",
        "Lost sheep need a shepherd.  They crave the direction, the security that comes with having someone show them the path they need to take.  Guidance is what they need for comfort.  Appeal to the part of them that is broken – their faith.  Repair that, and they will follow you anywhere, even unto death.",
        "Not the inquisitors.  They are practitioners of divine power, and see to it that the will of those powers is carried out.  While the inquisitors are certainly examples of faith to be followed here in Freeport, in this case, their methodology of enforcement was not appropriate for what needed to be done.  It was possible that the populace would view it as another form of oppression.",
        "It was necessary to preach to the people in a way that brought them to believe the word for themselves.  Rather than force them to see the power and strength of Lucan, evangelize his accomplishments, and allow them to see them for themselves.  Once they have their own belief, they become easier to herd into the flock.",
        "We did.  We moved among the people, offering food and aid in Lucan's name.  We have stood on the corners of the streets, preaching of his deeds, and conducting sermons for all to see.  Almost immediately, we could see the dissension fading, and saw the people respond favorably.  Thus, our order was born.",
        "We are the Templars of Freeport.  We are his evangelists, his martyrs, the ones who preach his word to all that will listen. While the inquisitors enforce his will, we cultivate it, and bring the flock in under his name.  Sometimes the best method of enforcement, is to convince others that there is no enforcement.",
        "We are.  Many have approached us to dedicate themselves to Lucan, to spread his word, and to represent Freeport and the gods we follow.  Through our faith and conviction, we will help ensure that Freeport remains strong from the inside out."

        "That is correct. Under the benevolent teachings of Romiak Jusathorn, several Academy mages honed the craft of glamors, figments, patterns and shadows. The late professor was an enchanter of considerable ability. It is said that his illusions were so vivid that absolutely no one could discern their immateriality.",
        "Professor Jusathorn was once the Foci of the Academy of Arcane Science. Many considered him the last defender of the Academy's neutral stance in its teaching. He once said, \"Think not of good or evil. Instead seek only facts. Doing so makes one more likely to achieve good rather than those who view the world through the distorted medium of their own selfish desires.\"",

        "While the Overlord and Xelha Nevagon were consolidating the military and religious factions within Freeport, Opal Darkbriar wasted no time in usurping control of the Academy from Foci Jusathorn.",
        "Professor Jusathorn, along with those who opposed the dark arts, died in a devastating battle against Darkbriar and her sinister allies. The conflict caused considerable damage to the city and the Academy itself. When Darkbriar emerged victorious, it heralded a new age for the Academy of Arcane Science.",
        "Yes. For many ages the practice of necromancy was strictly forbidden from being taught within the Academy. Now, with Opal Darkbriar established as the new Foci, such restrictions were removed. Necromancers, long hidden within the shadows and darkest recesses of Freeport, converged upon the Academy and established a new school devoted to the black arts.",
        "None of them were thought to have survived the battle between Jusathorn and Darkbriar. With no one left to teach the art of Illusions, the knowledge was eventually forgotten. The curriculum of School of Enchantment became focused upon coercion and beguilement. Jusathorn's legacy was no more."

        "That is true, and has always been true.  Since it was originally taught by Grandmaster Tynn, the Swifttail Caste has taught the iksar to master their inner strength and the harmony of their body and spirit.  It is an honored tradition among the iksar, and is an order all iksar should be able to follow.",
        "Since Kunark was once again discovered by the people of these lands, we began to not only hear stories of iksar who no longer lived in their ancestral homeland, but we actually met many of these few iksar who were not born there.  When they saw the ranks of the Swifttails in practice, we could see a longing in some of them.  A realization that they had found something they lost.",

        "Because experience can change wisdom.  You see, since the discovery of our homeland, many monks from this part of the world have come to our training grounds, looking to complete the trails we laid before them.  We never expected any of them to pass, yet, occasionally, one would.",
        "We found that these monks did possess a strength, much to our surprise.  While it might be true that a given student cannot be Swifttail, perhaps others could learn enough of our art to become a weapon in their own right.  We could show the people of this land the strength and superiority of our own order.",

He had predicted that there might be conflict with my being here, and teaching our discipline within Freeport's walls.  Thus, he composed a message for the Overlord, and ordered that I present it if needed.",
        "I was sent here by Dominus Rile.  When we told him of our discoveries regarding the iksar of Freeport, it was he that devised the plan to bring the Swifttail teachings to them.  He personally asked me to make the journey here, and provided me with the means to make my way.",
        "Dominus Rile believes strongly in the strength of all iksar, and our traditions.  He seeks to expand our strength, and to help the people of Freeport who sheltered the lost members of the iksar race when the world shattered.",

        "Careful where you tread, adventurer. You're stepping on official Red Hood training grounds. It'd be shame if a recruit's stray arrow were to embed itself in that shiny forehead of yours.",
        "Mind your tongue, fool! The Green Hoods are nothing more than a bunch of butterfly chasin' nature-lovers. The mere sight of a broken twig causes 'em to break down in tears. The Red Hoods suffer no such weakness.",
        "Such a word has many meanings, does it not? It is true that we track our prey with little effort. Bird and beast tell us where our enemies maneuver. No weapon exists which we cannot wield with deadly efficiency. We are the crimson serpent that lay waiting in the grass for our next victim. Consider yourself lucky that the Jackal has no use for your hide.",
        "Why doesn't it surprise me that you've never heard of our revered leader? Hmm, where to begin? The Jackal was once a member of the Green Hoods before he became fed up with their weak-handed approach in dealing with orcs of Deathfist Citadel. Others viewed his methods as unsound or too brutal. Hmph!  Brutally efficient if you ask me.",
        "Why? Are you a spy? Who hired you? Did Ralem send you?",
        "Very well, if you really do wish to learn more about our kind, keep your lips sealed and I will tell you the real story of Jackal.",
        "Good. Now, listen up. I don't have time to repeat myself. The real reason Jackal left the Green Hoods was because they failed him when he needed them most.",
        "A few years ago, while Jackal was away reconnoitering troop movement outside Deathfist Citadel, a band of orcs stumbled upon one of the Green Hood villages.  While the guards easily slew most of the intruders, one orc managed to evade detection by ducking into one of the village cabins.",
        "Inside, the orc discovered a sleeping Feir'Dal who went by the alias, Thistle. As the orc approached her bed, she awoke and screamed in horror. Just as the wanton beast was about to bear down upon her, several Green Hoods burst into the room and found the orc holding a blade to the frightened wood elf's throat.",
        "In haste, the rangers fired their arrows into the fiend's back. The orc howled in pain and rose swiftly, placing Thistle between himself and the rangers. In a crude form of Common he barked for them to stand down lest he slit the elf's neck.",
        "The men reluctantly lowered their bows, allowing the attacker to exit the cabin and escape into the night with the girl thrown over his shoulder. Later, when Jackal returned from his mission, he learned of the attack on the village and the abduction of Thistle. ",
        "You see, Thistle was not only a member of the Green Hoods, but also Jackal's betrothed. When he insisted on going after the kidnapper he was met with protest from his commanding officers. There was no hope in finding her alive, they insisted. If anything, Thistle would be used as bait to lure the Green Hoods out of the forest and into a trap set by the Deathfist orcs.",
        "Jackal grew furious with his peers and accused them of cowardice. When his friends failed to take his side, Jackal quit the Green Hoods on the spot and went off looking for the orc who had taken his lover.",
        "Not before she was killed, unfortunately. Jackal found Thistle's frail body, beaten and smashed, in a clearing not far from the village. Though he would never admit it to us, I'm certain the pain he felt after losing her was immeasurable.",
        "Jackal made finding the murderer his singular focus. For months he stalked the orcs of Deathfist, slaying scores of their kind before he finally tracked down one who knew the identity of the village attacker.",
        "He learned that the orc, named Kogrish Nailripper, had a reputation for unpredictable cruelty and had recently killed one of Emperor Fyst's advisors. Rather than sentencing him to his death, the emperor decided to instead banish Kogrish to the Commonlands of D'Lere.",
        "The Deathfist Empire often exile their criminals and deserters to a newly organized horde known as the Bloodskulls. These orcs wage war against Freeport in hopes of performing some great act which gain them favor with those who cast them out.",
        "Correct. Along his travels, however, he met several who had heard of his tale and wished to join him on his quest for revenge. He named his followers the Red Hoods and taught us the skills he had once learned from his former order.",
        "Now we defend the innocent travelers who make the arduous journey across D'Lere, ever vigilant for signs of Kogrish Nailripper.",
        "Our business here is our own. Suffice to say, the Overlord is sympathetic to our cause and has offered to assist us in our quest. In exchange for his knowledge, Jackal has agreed to garrison several of us here to help defend Freeport's battlements with our bows. Additionally, we've agreed to teach those who we deem worthy the arts of a ranger."

        "Correct. The Conservatory cannot complete its tasks, and it is better that the familiars and in the company of adventurers. Here, please take this tome - it will explain who we are, how we came to be, and give you a list of most of the familiars that have gone missing. Perhaps you will find it useful.",

        "You have learned how to gather harvests, and whether or not you decide to learn a tradeskill profession, you'll find harvesting can be a useful and profitable pastime.  Are you interested in reviewing the crafting process?",
        "All right, let's learn about the crafting process itself.  You'll need to have some harvested elm, tin, and roots in your bags.  Shall I tell you a bit more about the crafting stations and your tradeskill arts, or do you want to just get going?",
        "There are a number of different crafting stations that can be used to make different items.  For example, you would use a forge to make metal armor, and a chemistry table to make potions.  The other crafting stations are:  the sewing table, the woodworking table, the sage's engraved desk, the stove & keg, and the jeweler's workbench.",
        "Each of the 9 tradeskill professions has its own 6 tradeskill arts, and there are also a couple of special arts that are used for recipes not related directly to one tradeskill specialty. The appropriate arts will appear as buttons at the bottom of the crafting window when you start to make an item.",
        "That's right. If you mouse-over or examine the arts in your book, you should see what each of them do.  Three will add progress, and three will add durability.  When you're crafting you will want to be sure you know which ones add progress and which ones add durability. If you're having trouble maintaining durability, use all your durability arts all the time!  Or to speed up progress, use the progress arts nonstop.",
        "The first step in crafting anything is the recipe.  The recipe you select determines what you will create.  Open your recipe book from the main menu, or press N, to see yours.  If you're new to crafting it will be empty, but as you gain more recipes they will be listed here and you can use the Search box at the top of this window to easily find recipe names.  You can also create custom filters using the Edit button.  ",
        "In this window you would select the name of the recipe you wish to use and then click Create.  You will need to be near a crafting station of the appropriate type.  If you click on the crafting station directly, your recipe book will automatically filter to show you only the recipes you can make on that station.  Once you click Create, you will move to the Resource Window which shows you the list of ingredients that recipe requires.  If you have all those, you click Begin and crafting starts.",
        "I'd like you to make a candelabra for practice. While you craft it, I'd like you to pay attention to the blue and green bars in the middle area.  This shows you your progress (blue), and the durability (green) of the item you are creating.  The goal is to increase your progress without losing too much durability.  To create the item, you need to fill all four blue progress bars.  If you lose at least one full bar of durability, you will not be able to do this unless you can regain that durability again.   It is safest to keep your durability near maximum just in case of unexpected critical failures.",
        "That's where the reaction arts I mentioned come in.  You can use these to add progress (blue) or durability (green). Mouse click these or press 1 through 6 on your keyboard.  You can use these skills proactively throughout crafting to influence the outcome - for example, use skills that add durability if your durability is dropping.  Every 4 seconds a crafting 'round' completes and you will see numbers indicating your overall progress and durability loss or gain for that round above the crafting station.  This is generally easier to see in third-person view (use your mouse wheel to scroll out).",
        "Of course, it'll be easier to understand once you can see it in action.  Here's a recipe book, and some fuel.  Scribe the recipe book by finding it in your inventory and right-clicking it.  Check that you have some elm, tin, and roots in your bags, and head over to the forge.  Click on the forge to bring up your recipe list, and select the recipe for the simple candelabra.",
        "Moving on to the next lesson, you should be aware that there are some hazards associated with crafting.  Why, back in the old days, it wasn't unusual to see piles of injured bodies beside the forge!  We've managed to build slightly less dangerous forges since then, but no matter what craft you choose, there are still dangers to counter.  ",
        "During the crafting process, you will sometimes see a warning icon appear in the area below the four progress bars.  The warning icon will match one of your reaction art icons, and will have a name indicating the type of danger. The crafter can correct these problems by ensuring the next reaction art they use matches the icon of the warning.  Successfully doing so will avoid bad things occurring (such as a loss of progress, or durability, or even injury to the crafter) and may also result in unusually good things happening (such as progress or durability gain, a skill bonus, or even the discovery of a rare harvest).",
        "No, that was a particularly easy recipe.  In most other cases though, you have the chance of these warnings appearing.  They're random, but will always occur at the beginning of a new crafting round.  You have until the end of that 4 second round to counter the event.  I'd like you to go to the jeweler's workbench now and create a lead bracelet.  You'll find the recipe in this book.  Take care this time to watch out for warnings and counter them correctly.  And don't forget you can also use your arts to help out even when there's no warning showing.",
        "Well done, I hope you avoided any serious injuries.  So, now you know the basics of crafting, and I hope you understand how to obtain the best quality results while avoiding injury.  Now, would you like to try a few more recipes to learn about the nine types of tradeskill you can specialize in?",
        "Well, let's see.  You've made a candelabra using the carpenter skills, and learned that carpenters make items that can be placed in houses.  Carpenters also make strong boxes for storage, and sales containers for selling items to others.  You've also made a bracelet: jewelers make jewelry like this, and they also make combat art upgrades for scout types.  ",
        "Now why don't you try your hand at provisioning, and make some jum jum cider?  Food and drink help an adventurer's power and health to regenerate faster between battles, so a provisioner's goods are always in demand.  You'll need some harvested jum jum, and some liquid, which the fuel merchant will sell (aerated mineral water works just fine, and adds that extra fizz).  ",
        "Next we'll look at weapons.  These can be made by both weaponsmiths and woodworkers.  Weaponsmiths are masters of metallic weaponry including swords, axes, daggers, and hammers.  Woodworkers are skilled at working with wood, creating wooden weapons such as staffs, batons, and cudgels, as well as bows and arrows and wooden bucklers and round shields for the defense of their allies.  They also craft powerful totems that possess restorative properties.  Practice both crafts by making a tin hand axe, and an elm greatstaff.",
        "Sages possess an unsurpassed knowledge of the arcane.  They apply this knowledge by scribing spells onto scrolls that increase the might of healers and mages.  Create a Scroll of Shackle and bring it to me.",
        "Excellent work.  Now let's look at alchemists; they create deadly poisons and magic potions from almost any material, benign or otherwise.  These concoctions provide benefits in battle, such as healing, resistance, or extra damage against a foe.  Alchemists also make combat art upgrades for fighter types to improve their abilities in battle.  Make me an Essence of Intercept to practice these skills.",
        "Now let's look at tailors and armorers.  Armorers focus on heavy plate and chain armor, while tailors specialize in the creation of lighter cloth and leather armor.  Tailors also make backpacks and other items from cloth or leather.  Show me that you can create a tin chainmail coat, and a rawhide backpack.",
        "Excellent work!  I hope you now have an idea of what each tradeskill class does, and how to do it.  At level 9 you'll need to decide which crafting path you will follow, by speaking to the Crafting Trainer near your local tradeskill area.  The Crafting Trainer also sells your recipe books, so be sure to pick those up!  Come back to me at any time and I'll be happy to give you refreshers on this information.  Should you choose to continue a career as a crafter, I wish you the best of fortune!",
        "Hello, friend!  I'm here to teach interested people a little bit about how to harvest crafting materials, and how to craft tradeskilled items.  Are you interested?",
        "Harvesting resources tend to be segregated by areas - for example, you'll be able to harvest items (often also called nodes) for making equipment for level 1-9 adventurers, in the same areas where you'll find level 1-9 adventurers hunting.  There are seven types of harvestable item:  wood, roots, ore, soft metal, animal dens, shrubs, and fish.  I'd like you to get a few harvests from each type of harvestable item."
