        "Hmm, maybe you are, maybe you aren't. It doesn't really matter in the long run, does it? If you are truly interested in why we are here, then I have a task you could perform to prove yourself, if you wish it.",
        "Funny... Do you want to learn or not, fool?",
        "Good. I need you to travel to each of our field scouts and deliver them supplies. They should be rather easily found. There are three camps: Two are here on the beach, and the other is just past the hidden beach path. Now, go. Please refrain from wasting both our time by puttering around aimlessly.",
        "Have you completed your tasks yet?",
        "And you're still alive... I'm impressed. Take this and speak with me again when you're ready for your next task.",

        "They have standing orders to attack anyone they do not recognize, so yes and no... Do you still wish to learn more about our order?",

We have heard rumors that the pirates are planning to expand off the beach and deeper into the forest. We do not wish this, of course. I need you to find the Tactician's tent and steal the attack plans. Can you handle that?",
        "Good. Be quick about it.",
        "Good work. I will give these to Szin. Take this for your time and return to me later. I have more tasks for you.",
        "Those plans were quite useful. More so than you, in fact. Nonetheless, I cannot ignore the aid you have provided, no matter how much I dislike that you have potential. I will give you another chance to earn our trust, if you think you can handle a real task...",
        "I need you to find the Tactician and Commander and scour them from this beach. The plans for taking over the forest were more involved than we thought possible of their little human brains. Can you handle that?",
        "Go quickly, before they begin to move.",
        "You have performed well. You show an interest in knowing why we are here. The book I gave you will answer many of your questions. You should feel honored; few have even touched that book in centuries.",
        "Yes, this of course isn't going to be, \"Oh, let's go sit under a tree and read this book!\" You should know better. These pages are shielded with an arcane magic beyond the comprehension of most mortal beings. It requires blood to reveal the truth written in its pages. You will know what kind of blood it desires when the time comes.",
        "All you have to do is take a look at the book and it will take you from there. If you manage to read the entire thing, come back and speak with Torq. He has more tasks for you if you wish to continue with the Trials.",

Let's just say the Overlord has decreed that the roads must remain open at all costs and sent our legion in to pacify the forest, but we've become a little understaffed.",

The fool was sick for days before the spiders got him, which may have been a mercy depending on how you look at it.",

You see, that strange idol that you found the native Murkblooms worshipping was sent to the Dismal Rage for study. When we began examining it, we immediately realized that it has collected a sort of strange power that must have come from something within the forest, from some greater source, or perhaps even from the forest itself.",
        "Well, we’re really not quite sure. It’s all very strange. As a druid I can in a way communicate with the wild plants and creatures of the forest, but for some reason I cannot understand most of the beasts and plant life here. It’s almost like they’re speaking a different language. The trees that I can speak to have been withdrawn and hostile, and so I haven’t been able to discover why I cannot comprehend the others.",
        "That is where you come in. You found the idol that we have become so interested in and I’m hoping that you will be willing to assist me in uncovering more information about the changes in the forest. Well, familiarize yourself with this camp and then come see me once you’re ready for your first task.",

I’ve never heard of anything like these new plants that seem to be growing everywhere here now, and I think they may be able to provide me with more clues about the causes of the changes.",
        "Good. I need you to find the plants in the wild and catalogue them for me while I study some samples the soldiers were able to bring back. It seems the plants are not as defenseless as one may assume. I will need one of each kind catalogued... here, let me write them down for you in your journal. Once you have catalogued one of each type, return to me.",

        "...seems to be imbued with a strange magical energy dissimilar to any... what? Oh yes, the adventurer. I was just finishing some of my notes. Are you ready for another task?",
        "Good. These new plants are incredibly interesting. I’ve had some time to examine these plants now and I’m certain these did not grow through any traditional means. I’ve also been studying some of the older growths in the forest and, well, it’s just astonishing!",
        "I’ve discovered that both the strange new plants and the older growths in the forest have a collective consciousness! At first I thought I was mistaken, but the more I look it becomes obvious that this is the only way to describe the behavior of the plant life in Nektulos. I mean it’s almost like the forest is a single entity. It has a mind!",
        "Yes! And I’m thinking maybe I can try to speak to it, but I will need your help in gathering the components to do so. I’m going to need heartwood from the blacktimber treants and some spores from the Murkblooms. Both can be found near Bone Lake.",

Yes, that's the way to put it. It hates... everything. This is both very worrying, and breathtaking. The forest’s mind is not new. It is old and has been dormant for a very long time, but is now awakening. But that is not what is causing me to worry.",
        "The forest has emotions, hate being most prominent. It especially hates intruders and outsiders, which it feels we all are. But the emotion I sense that worries me is that it is almost joyous over something. It almost reminds me of a loyal hound. This is very troubling news. Thank you for your assistance, friend. I think I must now return to Freeport to report on this.",
        "Ah, but before I forget... Lieutenant Kaneth sent over some armor pieces to reward you for your services. You may choose whichever you find most useful."

        "Oh you do, do you?  Then perhaps ... perhaps I can satisfy your thirst for adventure. I left the forest for ... a long time, and need to know what changed ... in my absence.  I'll reward you well for your observations.",
        "Go see why the behemoth that guards our pristine forest is allowing outsiders to walk freely.  Its lair is beside the river that runs through the forest ... or so the stories say.  Return when you find out why the beast isn't performing its duties.",
        "Is that so?!  How can this be?  The bonds that held this beast were the tightest ever crafted!  I mean, if the texts are correct, that is.  This does not bode well ...  but this matter doesn't concern you.  As promised, here is your reward.  Hmmm ... Perhaps you're interested in more work?",
        "So I see I piqued your interest ... or perhaps just your greed.  Either way, it matters not what your motivations are, just as long as you bring me your observations of areas both near and far within the Nektulos.",
        "Well, perhaps near isn't the proper word. Direct might be the better choice. At the source of the river are the Timber Falls. I must know if ... indigenous pests still live there. Would you investigate the area for a substantial reward?",
        "Then we agree. Follow the river north until it bends to the west.  Shortly thereafter, you should approach the falls.  Check closely for signs of the disgusting vermin that may live there.  I suspect they hide behind the falls.  Return when you determine the status of the filthy creatures.",
        "Far in the sense that you will need to travel here and there.  I am in need of information regarding the current status of the warning torches that were erected since we ... since I've been gone.  Perhaps you would be willing to gather together the locations of these torches ... for a sizable reward, that is...",
        "I wish to know if some specific ones have been lit. Seek the torches that travel from the south of the Combine Spires all the way east to the stone bridge. I believe you should find all eight of them upon the path, if it has not worn away over time. I need to know if a warning has been signaled ... or if the owners are still blissful in their ignorance.",
        "Well, at least those warrior-minded fools accomplished something!  I expected those pestilent little halflings to still be in our land.  But, I digress about matters that are not your concern.  Here is the reward for your time.",
        "I see ... perhaps the veil of ignorance is more of a deceptive mask on their part, eh?  But I speak too much... especially to one such as yourself.  And you would be far safer not to think too much upon the muddled words of a curious old man.  As I assured you, here is your reward.  Now leave me to my considerations.",
        "Hmmm ... you've proven yourself to be most helpful--for one among the living. Perhaps it would benefit both parties if you stayed that way. Yes ... yes I have something else I need to know ... something quite important. By taking on this task, you will have intertwined yourself to us far greater than you can imagine. Is this your will?",
        "And thus you have spoken those words on your own accord. I now task you to find out if they have ever managed to break open the gate. The great Fire Guard was erected to hold back the scaled menace that resides to the far north of Nektulos. Find out if they traffic with the nemesis. Tell me if the Fire Guard has been broken.",
        "As I had suspected. For as much as they moan, they have not the courage to take the steps necessary. Hahaha! My Empress will be most pleased to hear those pathetic fools have degenerated themselves to nothing but domesticated dogs under her rule. As for you ... here is your reward. Your health is tied to your silence ... remember that."

Last night one of the sentries managed to catch one of the culprits.",

Just hunt them down and see if any of them still have the supplies. After our last attempt at foraging, I'd prefer not to have to try it again. Are you willing to help us out?",

Oh, and while you were out dealing with the grinnin, someone came through here that was looking for you. But get some rest first; you look like you need it. After you’re rested, come see me and I’ll tell you where to find her.",

Just take the east road at the crossing north of here to get to Bone Lake. I’d tell you to be careful on the way there, but I don’t think you’ll need to."

Luckily, we are close to the fertile, sunny, bright and happy Thundering Steppes. There are usually food crates sitting unattended on the Steppes docks, especially in a building up the stairs when you first land. I believe a Sage is usually present, but he has never bothered us. Go and re-provision us.",
        "Hope you don't get sea sick.",

        "I see you weren't eaten by the owlbears. Ready for more?",
        "Good. What you are standing on right now is a beach. You know, sand near water. Go explore the water and bring me back the remains of others who tried to explore it.",
        "A little advice: Try not to look like food to the sharks.",
        "Well done. I'm impressed that you're still in one piece. Here is a little reward for you. Come back when you dry out.",
        "Since you still have all of your limbs, it is clear you haven't been risking them enough. I know you've been avoiding the owlbears and, not only does it hurt their feelings, but it makes me think you are a coward. You aren't a coward, are you?",

        "Have you been able to select a single item from its greater surroundings?",
        "Two of three meanings of life have I taught you. But have you truly learned your lesson?  Broadening the mind through travel and seeing the minute among the mighty are two ways to strengthen your understanding.  The final way is through personal effort, which will enhance your self-awareness and control.",
        "Your mind is active, my child.  It is time your body followed suit.  These personal efforts will enrich you and through these efforts, you will achieve a greater insight into this meaning of life.  Follow these simple instructions and return when you understand.",
        "You've returned, as I had foreseen.",
        "I am not telling you everything, only that which you might comprehend.  Your personal efforts work in concert with the broadening of your mind and the exquisite vision techniques of seeing that which is unseen by many.  Three meanings of life that coalesce into one simple constant.  Do you understand now, my child?",
        "Then you are not ready, my child.  A pity.  Perhaps when you have studied for as many years as I have, you will realize that these three meanings of life are essential elements of all that you experience.  The broadening of the mind, seeing the individual amongst the many and personal effort.  I foresee much personal effort on your part."

        "The streets of Neriak slowly began to empty. The great dark elf army's numbers dwindled as the Necromancer fed on everyone and everything. His hunger could not be contained. The many mages of the dark elves figured out what was happening and joined together, using all of their combined power, to bury the Necromancer's lair far below the earth. But we have received reports that the Thexians, in their misguided attempts at power, have disturbed this lair.",
        "I tell you because I, like my fathers before me, have been given the duty of making sure this Necromancer will never be unearthed. The cataclysm has hindered our efforts. Fallen Gate, that wretched evil place, has been excavated and it seems several artifacts of this Necromancer were looted by the Thexians. They are using them to join and raise the Necromancer. I cannot let this happen.",
        "Well, I tried, but unfortunately I was wounded in my attempt. I take much pride in my fighting ability, but I was not prepared for the Thexians' numbers. I fear they will reach the lair's ruins before I am healed enough to stop them.",
        "I suppose if you wished to help, you could find the artifacts and stop the Thexians or at least delay them until I am healed.",
        "They are blood runes. Special stones made with the blood of the Necromancer, providing him an undying tie to this world. You need to retrieve all five. If the Thexians even have one of the stones they can cause quite a bit trouble.",

        "Unfortunately, I am still suffering from my injuries. I can barely stay on my feet, so there is no way I could enter the lair and stop the Thexians. I would be indebted to you if you would go there and investigate the situation. My greatest concern is that they may be attempting to raise the necromancer from his grave. Please, go see if they are and stop them.",
