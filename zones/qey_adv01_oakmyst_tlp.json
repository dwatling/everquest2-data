        "Well... I do get nervous when the Tunarian Alliance steps in. It's probably nothing, but they requested a stronger Qeynos Guard presence here. I think they know more than I do.  Still, the danger Oakmyst Forest is in is pretty minor.",
        "Minor danger. Sure, we can use help, but it's not an emergency like some might have you believe. Would you care to volunteer?",
        "Good, glad to hear it. Even without all this \"supposed\" stuff going on I've got my share of duties. An adventurer was slain recently in these parts. Our initial report back seems to suggest poison. The problem is we have no idea what kind of poison. We know that certain animals in the forest use poison. We suspect that the poachers also use it.",
        "Well, the poachers are spry enough to avoid detection, so we can't get a sample of their poison from them. We can, however, collect poison samples from some of the wildlife here and use that as a starting point. At most, we can find out what caused the death, and at the least we eliminate some possibilities. What do you say?",
        "Good. Collect some poison samples from frogs, mystail rats, and the spiders. They can all be found in Oakmyst.",
        "Be careful out there.",
        "Have you collected the poison samples yet?",
        "Excellent. I'll send these back to Qeynos as soon as I can. In the mean time we can still use your help, are you willing?",
        "Another one of those weird reports. Dirt piles have been turning up all around the Oakmyst Forest and we have no idea why. I'd like you to go get some mineral samples from the piles and maybe we'll be able to figure out who put them there and why.",
        "It may be nothing, but it may help us greatly.  Thanks for doing this.",
        "Have you collected the soil yet?",
        "Thanks. Maybe this will turn something up, maybe not. I'll send it off to be studied and we'll get some answers. I've received an unofficial request for my presence at the docks west of here. I'm sure it's nothing too important, how' d you like to go in my place?",
        "Great. Go speak with Bardrian Vorsuth, a dock worker. If experience teaches anything my money says Bardrian's going to report \"something strange\" that \"confuses\" him and he doesn't know what to do.",
        "Bring his news back to me. We'll add it to what we've already got.",
        "Bardrian?",
        "Strange machine? What else can you tell me? This may relate to information we discovered from a book we found on a Freeportian gnome a short while ago.",
        "And the other machines?",
        "Hmmm, according to data we intercepted there should have been. You know, things may be starting to come together. There are at least two other machines, I believe we've already seen signs of one: the dirt piles. It was meant as a dirt displacement device, and according to information we intercepted it was being tested here.",
        "No... But the soil you recovered did have elements consistent with processing: the grains were uniform in size, the soil had small traces of elements that are not natural to Oakmyst Forest. To make matters worse none of the soil recovered was top soil, whoever is digging has been digging deep.",
        "The other machine's purpose was unknown, but we know it involved water in some capacity. Maybe that machine is another test or maybe its purpose is more sinister, either way we need to find it. It will be in or near water, you need to figure out where it is. If it can be easily removed do so, but otherwise do not worry about that--just find out where it is located and report back to me. The most likely spot is near the Western Falls.",
        "Did you find the machine?",
        "Good work, we'll get our people on that right away. I've had my people searching for the other machine but they're coming up without results. Something in my gut tells me it doesn't matter, that it's no longer here. But that doesn't matter, at least not yet. What does matter is our men displacing the machine you found. While they do that I have another task for you.",
        "We've intercepted clues about a possible meeting regarding the machine we found on the docks, apparently it was supposed to be removed from the docks quite some time ago but never was. We don't know who will be involved in this meeting but we'd like you to break it up. Once we figure out who is behind this it will give us a big clue as to what's been going on around here.",
        "Be safe. They won't appreciate this, heh.",
        "Did you interrupt the meeting?",
        "What did you discover?",
        "Gnolls? Then all the reports were right. And that Gilrix. He was mentioned in one of the materials we obtained concerning this whole mess. But we may be a step ahead of them for once.",
        "The book we obtained had lots of notes and plans. The book you've provided to us has all their contingency plans. If you've disrupted the meeting then the gnolls won't know precisely what happened and will fall to one of their backup plans. This gives us an excellent opportunity to strike.",
        "Well, with this book we've got the locations where the gnoll lieutenants will be in hiding while they await orders from Gilrix. While they wait, they are vulnerable. One will be near here--take the path west and turn north before you go under the bridge, that should put you very near him, he's hiding in an alcove.",
        "Another will be on the rocky hill south east of Clearwater Pond. The last will be in a small alcove just north west of the Western Falls.",
        "Taking them out will be a huge victory for us here, good luck.",
        "Have you taken out the lieutenants?",
        "This is great news! With their lieutenants dead the gnoll presence here will be in shambles. Those that don't flee will easily be captured. You have done a great, great thing."
