        "Welcome, citizen. Please be careful around here.",
        "Yes, quite dangerous. We have been getting reports, strange reports, over the past few days. Nobody is sure exactly what is going on, and we don't have the manpower to find out once and for all. I've got scouts but even they can only do so much. We've got so few people that it's hard to take care of all the little things.  Ever since the pirates landed the Concordium has been asking for more and more protection.",
        "More than you know. With dead-end investigations, big threats, little threats, and vague orders from the Qeynos Guard AND the Concordium I'm amazed this place hasn't been put under siege by the hawks yet. I'm sorry for complaining to you. Listen, how would you like to help me out?",
        "Good, that's great news. The first thing I'd like you to do is help me locate a missing scout. Del Varun was assigned to the small pond on the western side of the ruins. He hasn't checked back in and hasn't been spotted in a few days. I'd like you to head that direction and see if you can find him.",
        "Don't be foolish. Don't get yourself hurt, but if you notice anything that might lead us to him please let me know about it.",
        "What is it, citizen?",
        "Alright, let's see. Hmm, you say you found this here? As in the Forest Ruins?",
        "This is disturbing. This looks like gnollish. It may be some random coincidence or the gnolls may be on the move, and Qeynos isn't sending anymore guards out here for the time being.",
        "Any news of Del Varun yet?",
        "Only his satchel? I was afraid of this. I wish we had some leads, he may yet be alive.",
        "Ah, good thinking. Did you see the glowing too? Perhaps it was a transitory thing.",
        "Incredible. Please, take this to Poko Zing over there. Have him analyze it for us.",
        "I don't know, but I'm hoping Poko will be able to tell us.",
        "Welcome back. Are you ready for some more work?",
        "It was part of an illusion. Poko made up some kind of dust that he says can dispel the illusion for short periods of time. So, it's time for us to figure out what someone has been trying to hide.",
        "Find out what those plants are hiding. I'd like you to take Poko's dust and go sprinkle it on the plants. Try to bring back some kind of clue if at all possible, I doubt it will all be nailed down.",
        "Plans would help the most. Some paper or a book or something of the kind.",
        "Well?",
        "Gnolls... was there anything else other than the book?",
        "That is quite unfortunate. The diagrams in this book look like they involve digging tools and machines. Thi- wait a minute! According to these plans the gnolls have digging tools stored all over the place! They are probably under the same magical veil as the camp.",
        "No, but we need to stop them. I need you to go back out around the ruins. Find these hidden digging tools, sprinkle some of Poko's powder on them, and destroy them.",
        "We'll drive these gnolls out yet!  Thanks for helping.",
        "Have you destroyed the tools?",
        "Good, good. I've been going over this book of theirs. These gnolls seem to be only one group of many currently on the move. I believe we can stop the ones here if we take out their leader. We can worry about the others later, or never. I've sent word to Qeynos, it is unlikely they will require any assistance from us. For now, how would you like to attempt something important?",
        "I know you can. A gnoll named Malox seems to be leading the gnolls around here. If we take him out, the rest will scatter. He will likely be near their hidden camp. They know we're on to them but they will not have had time to move their camp yet. Go there and light their tent on fire, that ought to bring Malox out! Once he emerges, kill him.",
        "Be safe.",
        "Malox?",
        "Good. Very good. Well done. This is a huge relief. With Malox gone the other gnolls won't last much longer, at least the ones here won't. <player name>, Qeynos has sent word back. The Rockpaw Gnolls are responsible for what has happened here. It is time to move.",
        "We have gone on the offensive. The Rockpaw Gnolls have made their base within The Caves for quite some time, and we've decided to attack. Travel there and speak with Consul Bree, she will have orders for you. Thanks again, <player name>, you really came through for us out here.",
        "I wish I could go with you into the Caves. Good luck."
