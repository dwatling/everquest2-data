        "And be careful. Zen'Durath will not be pleased to see you.",
        "Is Zen'Durath dead?",
        "Then it is done, and the Rockpaw shall soon fall. I am very relieved. I am lucky to have you, <player name>. Please, take this as a sign of my thanks, and the thanks of the Queen. You have earned it.",
        "I am glad you are here.",
        "I was here on my own a short time ago. These Caves are home to a few gnoll clans: the Dustpaw, the Mudpaw and the Rockpaw. Previously they had fought amongst themselves. After a series of strange reports from a few of the areas that surround Qeynos, I was sent here to investigate a possible link.",
        "A strong link. Among the Rockpaw gnolls a new leader has come, High Shaman Zen'Durath. He's smart, smarter than any other gnoll I know of. He rallied the Rockpaw gnolls and brought them victory over the other two clans. He then reestablished ties with Blackburrow. Blackburrow provided him with some contacts. Through these contacts Zen'Durath got in touch with a few Freeportian engineers, Fluwkowir and Fulkoir Haggleton.",
        "There had been gnoll sightings in the Forest Ruins, the Oakmyst Forest and the Peat Bog. That alone is very strange. There were also reports of gnolls possessing strange machines. The purpose of most of these machines has yet to be deciphered. A couple, however, are known to us. One is meant to dig, and the other is meant to poison. When I arrived here things were quiet, for a time. Now that is no longer the case.",
        "The gnolls have brought an expert smithy from Blackburrow. They've been creating armor to outfit an army for some time now. And that isn't the only source of noise... The Haggletons have provided these gnolls with massive digging machines. When I was last down here the plans were not finalized, but it looked like they were going to tunnel directly into Qeynos. This is why we must act discreetly. Panic would only complicate things at this point.",
        "I believe so, though not directly.",
        "To begin with you can help me retrieve an updated copy of the gnoll field book. My copy is more than a few weeks old and these gnolls are more organized than one would like to credit their race capable of. The leaders of each clan of gnolls within these caves will have the order book. There is a Dustpaw gnoll camp west of here, on this level. Retrieve their field book. It may be encoded. If you see a small symbol of a paw held to an eye, then it is encoded. If it is, then you must find the key to the cipher; this could be carried by any gnoll. Once you have the key, bring it and the book back to me so I can study it.",
        "And be wary of the Dustpaw. They didn't have the strength to beat the Rockpaw, but that doesn't mean they're docile."
