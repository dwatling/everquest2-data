        "I am glad you are here.",
        "There are problems here that must be solved. You and I are part of that solution.",
        "The Rockpaw gnoll clan has wrested control of these caves to themselves. They are planning something very large.",
        "To begin with you can help me retrieve an updated copy of the gnoll field book. My copy is more than a few weeks old and these gnolls are more organized than one would like to credit their race capable of. The leaders of each clan of gnolls within these caves will have the order book. There is a Dustpaw gnoll camp west of here, on this level. Retrieve their field book. It may be encoded, if you see a small symbol of a paw held to an eye then it is. If it is then you must find the key to the cipher, this will be carried by any gnoll. Once you have the key, bring it and the book back to me so I can study it.",
        "And be wary of the Dustpaw. They didn't have the strength to beat the Rockpaw, but that doesn't mean they're docile.",
        "That you are. I appreciate your answering the summons.",
        "Have you gotten the gnollish order book yet?",
        "Great! This will prove to be very useful I am certain.... yes, their plans are as we suspected. <player name>, we need to put an immediate halt to their production! Are you ready to act again?",
        "The gnolls are creating an army that will be used to invade Qeynos. I have had Emma work up some explosives just for times like this. Take these charges. I need you to destroy the forge in the armory, it is on the level above this one. The gnolls also have a number of machine parts scattered around. These are not the two, main digging machines that they are using, but they are still part of the gnoll war machine and should be destroyed.",
        "Thank you. The gnolls may not recover from this.",
        "Have you done as I asked?",
        "Wonderful. A setback like this will cost them dearly. They may not have proper time to recoup. I do not intend to give them that chance.",
        "Zen'Durath. If we take him out now the Rockpaw gnolls will appear weak. The Mudpaw and Dustpaw gnolls will exploit that weakness, and the gnollish plans for Qeynos will never be realized.",
        "I know enough of these gnolls. I did stay here for quite some time, hidden but among them, you realize. The Rockpaw have a ritual they use when they wish to speak with Zen'Durath. If we mimic that ritual he will show.",
        "First you must collect the necessary items. You will need five crown scales from the albino pythons. You will also need some of the Rockpaw shaman's incantation powder, you can find this in the Rockpaw camps. Finally you will need a river stone from the river behemoths. These can all be found on the uppermost level here. However, the river stone may be difficult to get.",
        "Speak with Emma about the river stone. I believe she has been working on something.",
        "Have you collected the materials?",
        "Then I have all I need. I will make the staff of summoning now. Do not be alarmed, the skeleton that adorns it is not a recent one. With this staff Zen'Durath will be summoned. Are you ready?",
        "Good. Take this staff to the large skull on the northern end one level above this one. Once there place the staff in the skull, this will bring forth Zen'Durath. Return to me when he is dead.",
        "And be careful. Zen'Durath will not be pleased to see you.",
        "Is Zen'Durath dead?",
        "Then it is done, and the Rockpaw shall soon fall. I am very relieved, I am lucky to have you, <player name>. Please, take this as a sign of my thanks--and the thanks of the Queen. You have earned it."

Sure an ogre can smash all he wants, but with a fraction of that effort a correctly placed explosive charge can render far more damage. That is why I am here.",
        "Consul Bree asked for me. Well, not me specifically, but the Engineering Guild knew I was perfect for the job. These gnolls have come across some terrible machines, <player name>.",
        "Devices that can be used to tunnel through rock with the speed of dynamite, but the subtlety of manual labor. I have reason to believe that these machines--among others--were provided to the gnolls by Freeportians. A pair of gnomes: Fulkoir and Fluwkowir Haggleton. Consul Bree has seen the machines, that is why she has called for me. And I'm almost ready to move.",
        "As soon as I get a large enough collection of blasting powder. I have enough for the smaller devices, those that Consul Bree will be able to take care of--my precision won't really be needed. But the Freeportian gnomes have finished construction on two monstrous machines. Those machines are here, now in the Caves. And it falls to me to destroy them. But I need help.",
        "All around here are the wasteful remnants of previous dig projects. You will find copious amounts of blasting powder among the ignored, powdered mineral that is spit out by their digging machines. Collect this powder for me.",
        "The explosive potential is... amazing! I can't wait!",
        "Have you collected the powder?",
        "Most precise! This will be enough to create both charges. Are you ready to help me again?",
        "When you find the machines, the 2830 series DDBDs, there should be two of them. For our purposes they are \"A\" and \"B.\" I doubt they'll even be labeled, but you should know them when you see them. It is important that you place these explosives on the main drive shaft, which is external to the inner workings. It will be outside the hardwood casing, it shouldn't be hard to spot. Consul Bree's information suggests that one of the two gnomes responsible for bringing this technology here is already dead. The remaining gnome, Fulkoir Haggleton, must be stopped. He will be near the Rockpaws, though he may be in hiding. Destroying his machines will certainly draw him out. Can you do this?",
        "Good. The machines are likely a couple of levels up from this one. I'm sure I'll hear the explosions from here. I do hope you enjoy yourself, hah hah!",
        "Well?",
        "Ah, yes. She had me studying those a while back. Very complicated procedure to draw the stone from a river behemoth. You need to kill one and then, from its remains, you can draw the stone to the surface. After that it is as simple as grabbing it. You'll need a Drawing Ray--one of my inventions--to get it.",
        "Sure. Be careful with it. I don't think it will explode and kill you, but I also don't want you using it anywhere near me.",
        "Most precise! I heard the explosions from here, I am glad you were not in them and that they were in the proper spots--they WERE in the proper spots, right?",
