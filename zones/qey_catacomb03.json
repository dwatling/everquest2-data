        "Keldrane made many enemies amongst his former friends.  My spirit needs rest, but his bitterness keeps me here.  If you find who betrayed Keldrane, you also set me free, so I am eager to help.  Why don't you speak with Vargon? Or with Borthen?",
        "Vargon thought Keldrane could do no wrong, to his own similar misfortune.  I hear his spirit, lost and confused, abandoned as we all were when Keldrane died.  Speak with Vargon about the day we drew our last breaths, side by side.  Borthen was another of our closest friends; I sense his spirit in this cursed lair, too."

        "That would make things much safer around here. I mean, one wrong component in this potion, and well ... it wouldn't be pretty. Since these look-alike deadly scarabs are here in the catacombs, I assume the ones I need are in their nest.",
