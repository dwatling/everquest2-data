Filthy and wild, they prey on the weak and unprepared.  On the other, the Bloodsabers have been said to be stalking the outskirts of the city, and perhaps even have agents in the catacombs.  If you were to choose one evil to fight, which would it be?",
        "Very good!  If Fippy had not returned to a wilder state after his adventuring days, I'm certain the gnolls habits would be much different.  Alas, that is neither a story for now, nor does it do much good to dwell on the past.  Perhaps some other time I can tell you that tale... For now though, prove your worth by killing ten of the beasts for me.",
        "The Bloodsabers are a nasty lot.  They're devoted to the god of death and decay, Bertoxxulous, or at least they were.  I'm not so certain of their religious affiliations these days, but rest assured, they're no good.  If you can manage it, check the catacombs or outside the city and kill ten of their members.  If we make it dangerous to be a member, perhaps others will think long and hard before joining their cause."

No sense leaving anything that might be used as evidence in case anything goes wrong.  There's no turning back now.  Are you ready to finish the job?"

My duties here do not permit the time to recover the tome. I can charge you with recovering this treasure - if you're capable of such an invaluable task.",
