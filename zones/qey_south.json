She's not, she just felt intimidated by Ellinnea.  That led to her feeling jealous and that led to Mary spending more and more time in the pubs.",
        "I wish Mary understood how much the project will mean for the safety of Qeynos.  For the safety of our children -- when we have them!  When we're done with our work, Qeynos will be safe from any type of incursion.  That's worthwhile, don't you think?",
        "Yes...and no.  This project is for the future of the city.  If I have to sacrifice my personal happiness, then so be it.  I can only hope that someday Mary will understand."
