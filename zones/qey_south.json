I trek for the freedom of knowledge and in my journeys across these Shattered Lands I have encountered sights both wondrous and shocking, but I have yet to encounter anything like the Druzaic Shrines.",
            "As I traverse the stormy highlands of the once plains I first gazed upon the beauty of the Druzaic Shrine. At first it was a glint from afar that called to me, beckoned me in some hypnotic fashion like a siren to the sailor. As I drew closer I could see the aura of magnificence sparkling and swirling about, I added haste to my steps.",
            "I came upon the Druzaic Shrine and found myself in awe of the splendor that danced all about. I must have been in a trance for days my thirst and hunger fed by the song of the shrine. Finally my eyes began to clear and I found myself bolts away from the shrine, partially bathed in its brilliance. Now with my senses intact I was finally able to gaze upon the shrine and record my sight.",
            "All about the image I found runes, symbols... a form of alphabet. As I stood there studying these runes thinking I would never be able to decipher such a complex code the shrine began to hum. The rhythm of the shrine began to seep into my mind and for an instance I could begin to read the runes, and then the unexpected occurred- the shrine vanished!",
            "Where once it did sit the Druzaic Shrine was no more! The beauty of the shrine had vanished before my eyes taking with it the key to a new language, a language of magic. I was on the brink of discovery and in an instant it was swiped from me. I wept for the grandeur that was almost comprehended, having seen a glimpse of arcane purity.",
            "The days went on and my exploration of the Shattered Lands had only begun. I continued on recording my sights, sights that could not compare to the song of the Druzaic Shrine. I had met up with my friend from ages past as he toured the land taking notes to be shared with all Norrathians. I too wished to share my knowledge and wished to share what would have been a new arcane language if the shrine would never have left me. I was alone with memories from within and beyond, words of pure magic.",
            "We had sailed to new lands together, my old friend and I. We walked over dangerous lands and all the while I believed the shrine to be gone forever. It was at this end of hope that the sound overtook my mind yet again, I could hear the song of the shrine! I swiped my friend's magic boots, boots of great haste, with them I soon found myself face to face with the shrine again, or so I thought.",
            "What I saw before me sang the song of the shrine, but contained runes of a different sort. This shrine was a member of the greatness that the first shrine was. With it I listened and learned more of the language unknown. I was yet again in a trance when my old friend awoke me, he had finally found me after three moons passed. As he shouted at me for foolish ventures we both were interrupted by the farewell of the new shrine. It was gone in an instant just as the one before.",
            "Weeks passed and my friend and I had almost lost interest in our conversations of the shrine. We found ourselves on a more terrestrial wonder, the extreme grandeur of a land ablaze- Lavastorm! It was on this land that I encountered another friend from my past, the first shrine!",
            "The shrine had appeared to me, popped into existence in the blink of an eye right before us as if it was there all the time. What was amazing was that when at first I met the shrine it was spellbinding and it's runes indecipherable, but now I could partially comprehend what I read upon the shrine. The shrine's language was almost mine, but I could learn no more from this one.",
            "My friend and I stayed at the shrine and planned to make camp there, but the dangers of the region forced us to abandon our safe haven. I left that land with more than the sights i had seen, I knew now that there were a few more of these shrines, I could feel them. I bid farewell to my friend as he boarded the Far Trotter for other sights. I must go on alone in search of the remaining shrines.",
            "I could tell you the end of this tale dear reader, but the mystery must not be destroyed. In a sense the mystery was what aided in my comprehension of the new language of arch mages and magical beasts. I know Druzaic and you now know it lives in our realm. Seek the splendor and song when you are in your journeys. Seek the dancing lights and the brilliant spheres of Kab, Zet, Uzu and Myr. These are your keys to Druzaic, language of pure magic."
