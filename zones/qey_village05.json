        "Which of your parents was elven?",
        "Heh. I wager you're a sentimentalist, then.",
        "I'm not always right, I just see patterns sometimes. Tell me, do you ever regret your heritage?",
        "That's good to hear. I used to feel shame when I thought of my heritage, but I've come to know better.",
        "Well, I could teach you if you like, but you may find the lessons boring. I have a friend who might be able to entertain you though. What do you say?",
        "Nothing, really. I'm no teacher. I can only put you in situations that you may learn from. I can try to help guide you, of course, but most of the work will be yours.",
        "I would like you to speak with two people and help them in their day to day business. Please seek out Gar Smolten and Lia Serene. Pay close attention to how they treat you. Gar should be behind the inn, speak with him first. Lia should be near the entrance to the Elddar Grove.",
        "I'm glad to hear it. Return to me when you have spoken to them.",
        "Have you talked with Gar and Lia yet?",
        "And how did it go?",
        "How did Gar treat you?",
        "And what of Lia?",
        "It is unfortunate you were treated as such, but not surprising. But, and this is the sad part, there is a different reason I showed you this aspect of humans and elves. It is true we are oft-judged because of our race, but we tend to share that trait ourselves. ",
        "Because we are both human and elf, as the two you just spoke with, we sometimes are stuck with the worst aspects of either race. In this case their subdued distrust of our race. When we share those negative aspects we tend to assume humans and elves will look down upon us, and we tend to see examples of this even when it's not true.",
        "That depends on what your past interactions with other races has taught you--and I don't mean just humans and elves. I will tell you that for me it is very hard to deal with. For others it is a not an issue. Let me show you another thing we must deal with.",
        "You will see. Go speak with Milo, he's probably in the scribe's shop. Ask him about Lyssia and hear what he has to say. Then, once you've talked with him, go speak with Lyssia. Speak with her of Milo and hear what she has to say.",
        "Good. Return to me once this is done and we will speak of what you heard.",
        "Ah, you again. Do you have time to help me? Something unfortunate has happened.",
        "I look forward to speaking of them, but something more pressing has come up. I was writing an essay and did something foolish. I was taking a short break and forgot to weigh them down. When I got back, they had been strewn about by the wind. I would look for them myself but I found a dog chewing on a couple of pages and now must re-write them. Would you do me the favor of finding them?",
        "Wonderful, I knew I could count on you. This will save me a lot of time. It looks like there are five pages missing, assuming they're not destroyed. They could be anywhere in the village by now.",
        "Have you gathered my missing pages?",
        "Oh! Wonderful. None of them very bad off, either. Thank you!",
        "Anyway, where were we? Ah, yes, Lyssia and Milo. How did they speak of each other?",
        "What they love about each other are the strengths of their individual races. Obviously love isn't that simple, but I believe this situation can be simplified as such. These strengths are important to keep in mind for an Ayr'Dal, especially if you ever get hung-up about sharing the weaknesses of two races. The strengths of humans and elves don't make us better people than other races, just as the weaknesses of humans and elves don't make us any worse.",
        "Indeed. It is a hard life sometimes, but it is also a life that is immensely rewarding. That is part of what I wrote about in this essay. Now that it is complete, I would like a friend of mine to have a copy. How would you feel about taking it to him?",
        "Take this to Elvic Garrett, who has ventured into the Forest Ruins. He's probably hanging around just outside the ruins. I'm sure you'll both be able to help each other.",
        "Thanks for your help, <player name>. I hope our discussions about our race will prove useful to you."

This isn't very hard, just check the ground in the area of each nest and verify that neither the nest nor any eggs have fallen. If any eggs are found that are not cracked collect them.",

        "So kind, yet so naive to the horrors of the past, tragedies to be repeated, no doubt. ",
        "I do not speak of trembling plains and torrential seas, I speak of the bane of elfkind, the eternal struggle between light and dark ... between above and below.",
        "Yes, the elves of below ... the Teir'Dal. Their hatred for the elves of the sun is a plague upon all of Norrath. Many have died in defense of elfkind, and I believe the bloodshed is far from over. It is an eternal war that burdens my heart.",
        "I wish it were that easy, but I am Feir'Dal, a wood elf, and I am sworn to defend the Laws of Tunare and her children till my final breath passes my lips. That is a day I look forward to with great rejoice.",
        "In my days, I have seen a multitude of my fellow treefolke give their lives in defense of Tunare's laws. Many were my family. I am haunted with the visions of battles of yore. I recall my beloved sister slipping from life while I wept with her in my embrace. ",
        "She drifted from this realm more than four-hundred-years ago in the Age of Turmoil. It was the great War of the Fay, the war of the elves. The elf empire of below and their allies challenged the combined nations of elfkind. Armies of Teir'Dal, orc, troll, and others crept towards the Faydark hoping to extinguish the elves of sun.",
        "I was but an adolescent, barely able to string a bow, yet I fought. My sister was in her prime, and she was a highly-skilled scout, an elite soldier of the Scouts of Tunare. But even her skill could not prepare her or the tree city of Kelethin for the onslaught from the northern coasts and the orc hordes from Crushbone.  ",
        "It happened quickly. The forest empire of my people was greatly protected. No branch was without a lookout, the tall masts and far reaching ballistae of the Koada'Dal wavejumpers patrolled the coasts, but still, we couldn't prepare for the arrival.    ",
        "From the depths of the burning wastelands of Crushbone, came the orc hordes. As we directed our efforts at repelling this force, an armada of war galleys of Neriak breached the coastal mists. Some say they arrived via a titanic teleport arch built by the dark elves deep in the uncharted seas of the Ocean of Tears. Yet, still, they struck from an unexpected front...",
        "Near the heart of the Faydark, the most dangerous of the evil hordes arrived in a portal opened between the underworld and our forest, a portal bound by the ancient teleport spires. Wave after wave of Teir'Dal dragoon marched from this portal, a juggernaut marching towards the Koada'Dal city in the clouded mountains, Felwithe.        ",
        "The tree city was no target of the dragoons, the orcs of Crushbone kept us under siege, setting much of the Faydark on fire! Within the raging inferno, the dragoons marched to seize Felwithe. It is there that the legendary King Tearis'Thex fell to the dark blade.          ",
        "Defeat seemed certain, but as we fought futile battles on many fronts, the horns of war were heard along the borders of the Faydark! The brigades of the dwarven empire Kaladim marched in from the western mountains, and from the east came the gnomes of Ak'Anon with their ticking and puffing clockwork army. The elves of the sun would triumph this day.           ",
        "Greatly outnumbered, the dark hordes repelled. They retreated to the shadowed realms from whence they came. Some unfortunate ones fled to the Loping Plains seeking safe a haven on the moors of Mistmoore, never to be heard from again.  ",
        "Don't let my short tale confuse you. This war raged for more than a few seasons. Blood stained the forest floor, green turned to ash. It was in the final defense of Kelethin that my sister sustained a mortal blow, dying within my arms, her last breath gracing my tear-soaked face.  ",
        "Kelethin and Felwithe were restored under the guidance of the princess Queen, Lenya Thex, but the scars remained, both upon the land and within my memory. I departed the Faydark in search of a new life that would bury my visions of the war, but as I learned, war is eternal and it is far reaching. Since my days in the Faydark, I have traversed much more bloodshed. It is inescapable, yet I live on to defend the Laws of Tunare and to honor those that have fallen, such as my beloved sister Geeda.  "
