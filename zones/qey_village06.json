        "Well ... I ... I can't, I just can't describe the things I've seen. I can tell you what I feel, and what I think, I suppose.  Yes, it's better this way.  The world should know that the Vale ... well, it just might not be there anymore, at least not in the way we know it.",
        "Oh, I know. But you see, Rivervale and the Misty Thicket were special; they weren't harmed in the Cataclysms!  Somehow our lands survived unscathed!  It was a paradise when the rest of the world was broken and shattered.",
        "Yes. It did.  Something is happening in the vale at this very moment!  It's ... it's terrible!  I just ... I just don't want to think about it!  I can't!  I'm really very sorry, but I just can't.  Not yet.  I need time, just a little time for the nightmares to go away...",
        "I know, I know, but you haven't seen what I've seen!  You haven't heard the screams in the night!  Oh, those ghastly, horrific screams of pain and ... and merriment!  Cries of merriment in the slaughter!  It's ... it's happening now!  Right now!  They're suffering and I can't help them!  No one can help them!",
        "Death and suffering!  All of them dead and suffering!  They ... they bring it!  They revel in it!  It's like wine and song to them!  They're beyond evil, and they won't stop until they reave every last bit of life from the land!",
        "Terrible, horrible things in the night.  They shriek and howl, and then they sing softly and tenderly and sooth the nightmares away.  They're here for all of us; they won't stop until they've drained all life away.  Oh no, Launa!  My sweet Launa!  She's still there!  I abandoned her!  I had to, my sweet Launa, I had to ...  you were lost to them, but I couldn't do it!  I just couldn't do it!  Oh, please forgive me..."
