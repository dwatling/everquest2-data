Sure an ogre can smash all he wants, but with a fraction of that effort a correctly placed explosive charge can render far more damage. That is why I am here.",
        "Consul Bree asked for me. Well, not me specifically, but the Engineering Guild knew I was perfect for the job. These gnolls have come across some terrible machines, <player name>.",
        "Devices that can be used to tunnel through rock with the speed of dynamite, but the subtlety of manual labor. I have reason to believe that these machines--among others--were provided to the gnolls by Freeportians. A pair of gnomes: Fulkoir and Fluwkowir Haggleton. Consul Bree has seen the machines, that is why she has called for me. And I'm almost ready to move.",

I have enough for the smaller devices, those that Consul Bree will be able to take care of--my precision won't really be needed. But the Freeportian gnomes have finished construction on two monstrous machines. Those machines are here, now in the Caves. And it falls to me to destroy them. But I need help.",

        "The explosive potential is... amazing! I can't wait!",
        "Have you collected the powder?",
        "Ah, yes. She had me studying those a while back. Very complicated procedure to draw the stone from a river behemoth. You need to kill one and then, from its remains, you can draw the stone to the surface. After that it is as simple as grabbing it. You'll need a Drawing Ray--one of my inventions--to get it.",
        "Sure. Be careful with it. I don't think it will explode and kill you, but I also don't want you using it anywhere near me.",
        "Most precise! This will be enough to create both charges. Are you ready to help me again?",
        "When you find the machines, the 2830 series DDBDs, there should be two of them. For our purposes they are \"A\" and \"B.\" I doubt they'll even be labeled, but you should know them when you see them. It is important that you place these explosives on the main drive shaft, which is external to the inner workings. It will be outside the hardwood casing, it shouldn't be hard to spot. Consul Bree's information suggests that one of the two gnomes responsible for bringing this technology here is already dead. The remaining gnome, Fulkoir Haggleton, must be stopped. He will be near the Rockpaws, though he may be in hiding. Destroying his machines will certainly draw him out. Can you do this?",
        "Good. The machines are likely a couple of levels up from this one. I'm sure I'll hear the explosions from here. I do hope you enjoy yourself, hah hah!"
