        "If one of the right-click choices is grey, it means it is unavailable. You either need to be closer to the other player or be grouped with them.",

        "Very well. It began long ago in Ak'Anon when the King decided to hold a contest. It was grand.  The King invited everyone to make a clockwork king, and the one that most resembled him would win.",
        "The two favored inventors were my ancestor, Tizik Wobblecog, and an ingenious, but maligned tinkerer named Meldrath. They both submitted their designs, and after much deliberation it was found that the Wobblecog plan provided a much more accurate interpretation of the King.",

        "He cursed us with miscalculation! It's nearly driven my family to madness. ",
        "We're the most ingenious inventors, you see. We have truly inspired ideas, but can not ever see them through to completion because we fumble some inane formula.",
        "Oh, it is! Take my father for instance. We thought he had finally overcome the curse when he made that boat. It looked so beautiful and was more complete than any other Wobblecog invention has been in centuries. ",
        "Then, as soon as we got it out in the ocean, it sunk like a rock. Who knew iron wouldn't float?",
        "Luckily, my father had compensated for the curse. He knew something was bound to go wrong, so he completely encapsulated the boat, making it water tight just in case something went awry. Sure enough, the moment she left the berth the Ticking Tock fell straight to the sea floor.",
        "Oh, yes! There were several waterproofed whirligigs set up in a flagnuvian configuration to displace the meganominal gnoggnards.",
        "So here I am, sitting on the dock with all of the extra par... hmm... Oh! This seems to be a bit of a problem.",

        "You'd do that for me? Oh, thank you very, very, much! I'll stay here and ask the boat captain to wait for you to return, should he come. I'm missing three parts and I have no idea where they could be. I know they're on the island somewhere!",
        "I'm missing a size 7 clunker, a copper-coated springer, and a triangle spinner. If you could find them and bring them to me, I'd be forever grateful!",

You'll also see any benefits, such as attribute bonuses and resists, that the equipment provides. Learn about attributes by talking to Trainer Gurga Trueheart.",

        "How you judge armor depends on your profession. Fighters who take a beating care most about obtaining armor that has high Mitigation, which decreases the amount of damage they take. Mages, on the other hand, know they can't take much punishment anyway, so would rather have armor that provides nice attribute bonuses.",
        "Scouts and priests need varying amounts of protection depending on how they play. If they find themselves at the forefront of battle, protection becomes very important. If they stay out of harms way, attribute bonuses may be more valuable.",

At this point, you have a choice: wait for a nearby ally to revive you, or choose a location from the window in the center of your screen at which to reappear. In some cases you'll have a single choice, in others multiple choices.",

        "There are three results of death. First, you incur some experience debt which can be paid off by earning more XP. Second, you suffer a revive sickness that lowers your abilities for a short time, which leaves you temporarily vulnerable and less effective. Finally, all your equipped items take damage that will eventually have to be repaired.",
        "Experience debt is indicated by a red line on your XP bar. As you earn experience going forward, part of your XP will go toward paying off your debt while the rest will continue to advance you toward your next level. Mousing over your XP bar also tells how much debt you have.",

You may want to trade goods or services with other adventurers and artisans to obtain such valuable recipes. You can view your recipe book by pressing the N key.  ",

Or you can begin by using one of your spells or combat arts to get the enemy's attention. Remember, you must be close enough to actually hit them.",
        "You can fight most non-player characters and creatures that you find outside your city, whether outdoors or in dungeons. Many non-player characters in the cities are there to help or give you quests, so you can't attack some of them. If you try, you'll get a message telling you that they aren't valid targets.",
        "Ranged combat means that you put some distance between yourself and the enemy. This can be done with weapons such as bows or throwing daggers, or with spells and arts that can be cast from a distance.",
        "If you have a ranged weapon and ammunition, you can initiate ranged combat by using the Ranged Attack button on the Abilities tab of your Knowledge Book. You can drag this key to your hotbar if you like. Remember, you must have a ranged weapon in the Ranged slot of your inventory window and the correct type of ammunition in the Ammo slot.",
        "While most classes have the ability to attack from a distance, scout classes such as Swashbucklers, Troubadors, Dirges, and particularly Rangers specialize in ranged physical attacks. Mages, priests, and paladins have spells that do damage to their foes from a distance.",
        "You can right-click on a spell or art's icon and select \"Examine\" to see what its range of effect is. In addition, if you target something and the icon for one of your spells or arts turns a dark red, that means the opponent is out of range of that ability.",
        "Victory in battle can be very rewarding. Successful combat against a worthy opponent awards you experience (XP) to help you advance your level, as well as the chance at coin, usable items, and other valuables.",
        "You don't earn rewards for defeating foes that are too far below your level. If your target has a grey name, it means it is very weak and won't provide any benefit for beating it. Talk to Trainer Marla Gilliam for more information on evaluating your opponents.",
        "The tougher a foe, the better its chances to provide a valuable reward. Though defeating enemies alone provides nice rewards, defeating heroic enemies that require a group is even more rewarding. The very best items come from banding together multiple groups to defeat epic opponents.",
        "There are many advanced combat techniques that you will learn over time. There's no substitute for experience, <player name>! I'd be happy to discuss a few of these advanced aspects, such as selecting the right opponent, knowing your surroundings, and using your abilities.",
        "Keeping your surroundings in mind is crucial to victory. Fighting in areas with lots of aggressive creatures is a bad idea, because they won't hesitate to gang up on you.",
        "Staying too long on the exact spot where you just defeated a foe can be dangerous. Another enemy is likely to show up there soon after, which can be an unpleasant surprise if you're already in another battle.",
        "You should be aware of what's going on around you. Using your mouse wheel to scroll into third person and holding down the left mouse button allows you to move the camera around your character. It's a good idea to do this when fighting in dangerous areas to make sure nothing sneaks up on you.",
        "Successful fighting isn't about turning on your auto-attack and walking away from battle. Your odds of victory are much better if you prepare well and are active during combat. You should be using every spell or combat art that has a positive effect on your chances to win.",
        "Before you begin fighting, make sure you and your allies have activated all beneficial spells, also known as \"buffs,\" so that you're operating at peak efficiency. Buffs can add health or power, increase your rate of regeneration, enhance your physical attributes, make you attack faster or do more damage, and more.",
        "Whether you're a front-lines melee type or someone attacking from a distance with weapons or spells, you should be using abilities that damage your foes effectively and efficiently. Right click on your spells and arts and select \"Examine\" to see details on their effects.",
        "Using your highest-level versions of spells and arts will be more effective than using older versions. In addition, you should be upgrading your abilities to higher ranks to make them more effective. For more details on spells and combat arts, talk to Trainer Myrrin the Magnific in the tower at the center of the colony."

        "Welcome, adventurer! I sense that you will fight many battles and that you will one day be known as a great hero of Qeynos. But remember, we all have to start somewhere. The first thing you need to know to be successful in combat is how to size up your adversary.",
        "You must learn to use both your eyes and your instincts as you consider friends and foes in Norrath. There are two excellent tools you should use to judge their capabilities: what you can tell from their name and what you can learn by targeting them.",
        "If something has a red border around its name, that target is aggressive toward you and will attack if you get too close to it. You should be especially careful of creatures that roam around, because if they notice you they won't hesitate to strike.",
        "All you need to do is move your mouse pointer over what you want to target and click. You will see the name of your opponent in the Target window in the upper left corner of the screen, and a large arrow will appear above its head. If arrows also appear above the heads of nearby creatures, it means all of them are linked together and will attack as one.",
        "Sometimes multiple creatures will work together to form a single encounter. These opponents will act as a team, and usually won't stop fighting until all of them are defeated.",
        "The Target window tells you several important facts, which collectively form what is referred to as the \"con\" (overall challenge) of the opponent. It shows you the numerical level of the creature you have targeted, a color to indicate its relative level range, up or down arrows to indicate toughness, and indicators that tell you if the encounter is normal, heroic, or epic.",
        "As you adventure through Norrath, you will gain experience and increase your level. The opponents you will face in combat have levels as well. To be victorious, you will usually want to face foes that are close to your level.",
        "You gain more experience for defeating higher-level opponents, but they will be tougher to beat. Conversely, if you defeat foes much weaker than you, it will not be as rewarding.",
        "The color of the opponent's name indicates how challenging the encounter is. It is very useful as a quick indicator of whether or not you should try fighting a target. The more danger its color indicates, the greater the threat it represents.",
        "Grey names mean the fight is below your abilities and will give no experience or reward. Green names mean the opponent is very easy. Blue names mean an easy fight. White names indicate the opponent is even with your abilities. Yellow names mean the fight will be challenging. Orange names indicate a difficult encounter. Red names mean the battle could be deadly.",
        "Targets with grey names will not attack you, even if they would be aggressive to someone closer to their level. In other words, you won't be attacked by anything that won't give you some reward for defeating it.",
        "No arrow by the target's name indicates an average opponent for a lone adventurer. A single down arrow means it is a below average opponent. Two down arrows tell you it's a weak opponent, and three down arrows means it is very weak. Be careful though, because if multiple weak opponents are working together they can still be challenging.",
        "Up arrows indicate increased difficulty. A single up arrow means an above average opponent. Two up arrows show a strong opponent, while three up arrows means a very tough fight. If you look at the sparring partners next to us, you will see that they have different arrow indicators. Feel free to practice fighting them to feel what effect the arrows have.",
        "As a general rule of thumb, if you see an enemy with one up arrow, it's a good idea to team up with another player to take it on. If you see an enemy with two up arrows, add two members to your group. If you see an opponent with three up arrows, add three members to your group. A lone adventurer will likely want to face targets with no arrows or down arrows.",
        "A normal opponent has no indicator and is intended to be fought by a solo adventurer or small group. A heroic encounter is intended for a larger group of up to six adventurers. An epic opponent should only be attempted by a raid force of multiple groups working together.",
        "All the elements I've explained will affect the outcome of a battle and whether or not you will need allies to win. Pay close attention to the lessons I have taught you, and apply them to the challenges you face throughout your journeys in Norrath. Learn well and you will indeed become the great champion I know you can be!"

Spells and Combat Arts that are automatically granted to you are usually given at the Apprentice rank. You should always try to have the highest rank of your Spells and Combat Arts, because they gain effectiveness as you improve them.",
        "Spells gained through quests or racial abilities are usually at their highest level and cannot be upgraded.  Grandmaster spells are only available from your class training choices every ten levels starting at 14.  You can see the choices by selecting the L key on your keyboard.",
        "You will also find more potent ranks of spells and arts as you defeat opponents in battle. Many enemies will carry Adept versions of Spells and Combat Arts, while conquering some extremely powerful foes may result in the extremely rare Master versions.",
        "In addition, certain crafters can make upgrades to your Spells and Combat Arts using harvested components. They can create Journeyman quality spells, as well as valuable Expert scrolls using rare components. Buying from or trading with other players is an excellent way to upgrade your Spells and Combat Arts.",
        "As you advance in level, you will obtain many completely new abilities as well as more effective versions of Spells or Combat Arts you have already learned.

        "Beginning at level 5, Heroic Opportunities can be triggered in combat. They allow both lone adventurers and groups of allies to combine their attacks into a series of spells or combat arts performed in a specific order. When successful, Heroic Opportunities give beneficial effects such as extra attacks against your foes or beneficial magic to heal or enhance your abilities.",

All you need to do is use your ability that triggers the Heroic Opportunity, then use the spells or combat arts that are blinking on your hotbar or in your Knowledge Book. Easy, isn't it?",
        "Heroic Opportunities have two parts called the Starter Chain and the Combat Wheel. At level 5, every adventure class gains an ability that triggers a Starter Chain: Fighting Chance, Divine Providence, Arcane Augur, or Lucky Break. Open your Knowledge book by pressing K and click the Abilities tab to see it. You can drag its icon to your hotbar to use it.",
        "Starter Chains can only be triggered while in battle with an enemy. After all, Heroic Opportunities are all about becoming great in combat! When you or an ally triggers a Starter Chain, you will see it appear in the corner of your screen.",

A Starter Chain will generally display four different icons that indicate which spells or combat arts advance the Heroic Opportunity to the next stage. Icons will be blue, yellow, red, or green, depending on which class has the ability.",
        "Heroic Opportunities can be used alone or in groups. If you fight alone you will have a limited number of ways to advance the Starter Chain, but if you are in a group made up of different classes then you will be able to advance the Starter Chain in different ways to unleash a variety of Heroic Opportunities.",
        "Any spells or combat arts that can advance the Heroic Opportunity will flash on your hotbar and in your Knowledge Book. You have 10 seconds to complete the Starter Chain and advance to the Combat Wheel. See, it's easy: just use the spell or art that blinks!",
        "It's quite simple. After you've advanced the Starter Chain, the bright and colorful Combat Wheel appears. The Combat Wheel shows a series of icons and displays the name of the Heroic Opportunity you have triggered. A Starter Chain will initiate one of three different Heroic Opportunities.",
        "There are three potential Heroic Opportunities: common, uncommon, and rare. Each provides a different benefit. Though even the common ones are valuable, the rare event can sometimes turn the tide of battle in your favor!",
        "As with the Starter Chain, the Combat Wheel indicates which spells or arts must be performed to advance and eventually complete the heroic event. Sometimes these spells or abilities must be performed in a particular order. Other times there is no order.",
        "In the very center of the Wheel, you'll see either a clockwise-pointing arrow or arrows pointing in different directions. The clockwise arrow indicates that the abilities must be completed in order. The other types of arrows mean that the abilities can be completed in any order.",
        "The Combat Wheel must be completed within 10 seconds or the Opportunity will fail. The blue bar that appears around the outside of the Wheel is a timer. When the blue bar is gone, this indicates that time has run out to complete the Heroic Opportunity.",
        "It really is! As you become more familiar with using Heroic Opportunities, you can take note of the members of your group and plan out ahead of time which Opportunities will provide you the greatest benefit.",
        "Scout classes have a little something extra. By using their Coin icon, the Scout can shift to another Heroic Opportunity. This shift can only happen once per Combat Wheel. This ability must also be used before any other spell or combat art has been used to advance the Wheel."
