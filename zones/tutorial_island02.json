But for some unknown reason, they have begun to attack us. We need to begin an investigation at once to get to the bottom of this. Will you help?",
        "The goblins have started attacking us from the west. We're not sure what sparked the uprising, but they are now relentlessly trying to invade the colony. I need you to go see how our defenders are doing at the west gate and gather any information you can. Speak with Sergeant Haggus at the barricades and see what you can do to assist him.",

        "Hello my friend! I have the pleasure of serving Qeynos by explaining the role of crafting and tradeskills to newly arrived heroes such as you. By taking on the role of an artisan, you can help expand the influence of our fair city in worldwide commerce.",
        "Crafting, or tradeskilling as some call it, involves taking ingredients harvested or obtained in the world, mixing them with the proper fuel, and carefully following a specific recipe to create something new and useful for yourself or your fellow citizens. Just as you can gain levels by adventuring, you have a separate Artisan level that increases as you earn experience crafting.",
        "Crafting takes place in workshops, just like the one we have here on the island. Inside this doorway you will find the supplies, recipe books, and devices you'll need to build, cook, scribe, sew, and create all manner of useful goods. When you arrive in our grand city, you will find the entrances to workshops scattered throughout your home village.",
        "As you practice your craft you will learn to make a variety of products, but as you advance in your profession you will specialize in certain types of goods. If you buy the recipe books you'll find inside the workshop, you will see the types of items you can make.",
        "You might choose to become a Provisioner that makes food and drink, a Woodworker that crafts totems and staves, an Armorer that forges plate and chain armor, a Sage that scribes potent spells for mages and priests, or one of many other noble professions.",
        "Basic recipes can be bought for a small fee from a merchant inside any workshop, including the one here. Rare recipes can be obtained by adventuring in the wilds of Norrath. You may want to trade goods or services with other adventurers and artisans to obtain such valuable recipes. You can view your recipe book by pressing the N key.",
        "You can either use the items yourself or make a tidy profit by selling them to others. A skilled artisan is always in demand for the goods they provide, so learn your craft well and you will always have a place in Qeynos society.",
        "Here is a note that will begin your instruction. You may start crafting in our workshop here, or wait until you arrive in Qeynos. Just right-click on the note in your inventory and \"Examine\" it to begin. Your skills will soar in no time!"

        "Starting combat is easy. Just use your mouse pointer to left-click on an opponent. Its name will appear in the Target window in the upper left of your screen. You can also use the Tab key to cycle through nearby targets or the F8 key to select your closest enemy.",
        "If you're close enough to your foe and want to start hitting it with your weapon, either click your Melee Attack button on your hotbar or press the ~ key. Or you can begin by using one of your spells or combat arts to get the enemy's attention. Remember, you must be close enough to actually hit them.",
        "You can fight most non-player characters and creatures that you find outside your city, whether outdoors or in dungeons. Many non-player characters in the cities are there to help or give you quests, so you can't attack some of them. If you try, you'll get a message telling you that they aren't valid targets.",
        "Melee combat means a toe-to-toe, physical confrontation. It is a combination of auto-attack damage that happens automatically when you press the Melee Attack button on your hotbar or the ~ key and spells or combat arts that you use in close proximity to your foe.",
        "Sturdy fighters such as Guardians, Berserkers, Monks, and Paladins stand at the front lines of battle facing the enemy. Crafty scouts such as Swashbucklers, Rangers, Troubadors, and Dirges generally stay close to their foes as well, but prefer to launch attacks from the back or side where they are less likely to be counterattacked.",
        "So, did you defeat the sparring partner like I asked?",
        "Great work! You've proven your worth and are ready for greater challenges. If you want further instruction later, just come see me. But right now you must report back to Murrar so that you can discover what's behind the trouble here at the colony."
